Divisions  and  affiliated  companies  of  ExxonMobil operate or market products in the United States and most other countries of the world. Our principal business involves exploration for, and  production  of,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  manufacture,  trade,  transport  and  sale  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  petroleum  products, petrochemicals, and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, and lithium. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses. Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil , Exxon , Esso, Mobil or XTO .  For  convenience  and  simplicity,  in  this  report  the  terms ExxonMobil,  Exxon,  Esso,  Mobil, and XTO ,  as  well  as  terms  like Corporation , Company , our , we, and its , are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question. In October 2023 the Corporation entered into a merger agreement with Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company, in exchange for ExxonMobil common stock. The transaction is currently expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals. For additional information, see \"Note 21: Mergers and Acquisitions\" in the Financial Section of this report. The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive, both within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy,  fuel,  and  chemical  needs  of  industrial  and  individual  consumers.  Certain  industry  participants,  including  ExxonMobil,  are expanding investments in lower-emission energy and emission-reduction services and technologies. The Corporation competes with other firms  in  the  sale  or  purchase  of  needed  goods  and  services  in  many  national  and  international  markets  and  employs  all  methods  of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes.",

ExxonMobil has a long-standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology. We have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our businesses. ExxonMobil held over 8 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2023. For technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $155 million in 2023. Although technology is an important contributor  to  the  overall  operations  and  results  of  our  Company,  the  profitability  of  each  business  segment  is  not  dependent  on  any individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise, or concession. ExxonMobil operates in a highly complex, competitive, and changing global energy business environment where decisions and risks play out  over  time  horizons  that  are  often  decades  in  length.  This  long-term  orientation  underpins  the  Corporation's  philosophy  on  talent development. Talent  development  begins  with  recruiting  exceptional  candidates  and  continues  with  individually  planned  experiences  and  training designed  to  facilitate  broad  development  and  a  deep  understanding  of  our  business  across  the  business  cycle.  Our  career-oriented approach to talent development results in strong retention and an average length of service of about 30 years for our career employees. Compensation, benefits, and workplace programs support the Corporation's talent management approach, and are designed to attract and retain  employees  for  a  career  through  compensation  that  is  market  competitive,  long-term  oriented,  and  highly  differentiated  by individual performance.",

Many  of  these  risk  factors  are  not  within  the  company’s  control  and  could adversely affect our business, our financial and operating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors include: The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil’s operations and earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products. Oil, gas, petrochemical, and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity or product. Any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations, financial condition, and proved reserves, especially in the Upstream segment. On the other hand, a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations, especially in the Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products segments. Our pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage,  hydrogen,  lower-emission  fuels,  and  lithium  also  depends  on  the  growth  and  development  of  markets  for  those  products  and services,  including  implementation  of  supportive  government  policies  and  developments  in  technology  to  enable  those  products  and services to be provided on a cost-effective basis at commercial scale.

See \"Climate Change and the Energy Transition\" in this Item 1A. Economic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad-based economic activities and levels  of  prosperity.  The  occurrence  of  recessions  or  other  periods  of  low  or  negative  economic  growth  will  typically  have  a  direct adverse impact on our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population  growth  rates,  periods  of  civil  unrest,  government  regulation  or  austerity  programs,  trade  tariffs  or  broader  breakdowns  in global trade, security or public health issues and responses, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to rating, banking, or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of our  financial  assets  and  to  the  ability  of  our  partners  and  customers  to  fulfill  their  commitments  to  ExxonMobil.  Our  future  business results, including cash flows and financing needs, may also be affected by the occurrence, severity, pace and rate of recovery of future public health epidemics or pandemics; the responsive actions taken by governments and others; and the resulting effects on regional and global markets and economies. Other demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas, petrochemicals or our other products, and therefore impact our results, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns; increased competitiveness of, or government policy support for, alternative energy sources; changes in technology that alter fuel choices, such as technological advances",

See also “Climate Change and the Energy Transition” below. Other supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing sources tends  to  reduce  commodity  prices  to  the  extent  such  supply  increases  are  not  offset  by  commensurate  growth  in  demand.  Similarly, increases  in  industry  refining  or  petrochemical  manufacturing  capacity  relative  to  demand  tend  to  reduce  margins  on  the  affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as the level of  and  adherence  by  participating  countries  to  production  quotas  established  by  OPEC  or  \"OPEC+\"  and  other  agreements  among sovereigns; government policies, including actions intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, that restrict oil and gas production or increase  associated  costs;  the  occurrence  of  wars  or  hostile  actions,  including  disruption  of  land  or  sea  transportation  routes;  natural disasters; disruptions in competitors’ operations; and logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt  supplies.

ExxonMobil’s  business  results  are  also  exposed  to  potential  negative  impacts  due  to  changes  in  interest  rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, changes in usage of the U.S. dollar in global trade, and other local or regional market conditions. In addition to direct potential impacts on our costs and revenues, market factors such as rates of inflation may indirectly impact our results to  the  extent  such  factors  reduce  general  rates  of  economic  growth  and  therefore  energy  demand,  as  discussed  under  “Economic conditions”. Market factors may also result in losses from commodity derivatives and other instruments we use to hedge price exposures or for trading purposes. Additional information regarding the potential future impact of market factors on our businesses is included or incorporated by reference under \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" in this report. ExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations. Access  limitations. A  number  of  countries  limit  access  to  their  oil  and  gas  resources,  including  by  restricting  leasing  or  permitting activities, or may place resources off-limits from development altogether. Restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policies. Restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high commodity prices or when national governments may have less need for outside sources of private capital. Many countries also restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin.",

ExxonMobil  is  subject  to  laws  and  sanctions  imposed  by  the  United  States  or  by  other  jurisdictions where  we  do  business  that  may  prohibit  ExxonMobil  or  its  affiliates  from  doing  business  in  certain  countries  or  restrict  the  kind  of business that may be conducted, including acquiring or divesting certain assets. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions. Lack of legal certainty. Some countries in which we do business lack well-developed legal systems, have not yet adopted or may be unable  to  maintain  clear  regulatory  frameworks,  or  may  have  evolving  and  unharmonized  standards  that  vary  or  conflict  across jurisdictions. Lack of legal certainty exposes us to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts. In some cases, these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award. Regulatory  and  litigation  risks. Even  in  countries  with  well-developed  legal  systems  where  ExxonMobil  does  business,  we  remain exposed  to  changes  in  law  or  interpretation  of  settled  law  (including  changes  that  result  from  international  treaties  and  accords)  and changes in policy that could adversely affect our results, such as: • increases  in  taxes,  duties,  or  government  royalty  rates  (including  retroactive  claims  or  punitive  taxes  on  oil,  gas  and petrochemical operations); • price controls;",

N et-zero  scenarios. Driven  by  concern  over  the  risks  of  climate  change,  a  number  of  countries  have  adopted,  or  are  considering  the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including emissions from the production and use of oil and gas and  their  products  as  well  as  the  use  or  support  for  different  emission-reduction  technologies.  These  actions  are  being  taken  both independently  by  national  and  regional  governments  and  within  the  framework  of  United  Nations  Conference  of  the  Parties  summits under which many countries of the world have endorsed objectives to reduce the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) over the coming decades, with an ambition ultimately to achieve “net zero”. Net zero means that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities would be balanced by actions that remove such gases from the atmosphere. Expectations for transition of the world’s energy system to lower-emission sources, and ultimately net-zero, derive from hypothetical scenarios that reflect many assumptions about the future  and  reflect  substantial  uncertainties.  The  company’s  objective  to  play  a  leading  role  in  the  energy  transition,  including  the company’s announced ambition ultimately to achieve net zero with respect to Scope 1 and 2 emissions from operations with continued technology  development  and  policy  support  where  ExxonMobil  is  the  operator,  carries  risks  that  the  transition,  including  underlying technologies,  policies,  and  markets  as  discussed  in  more  detail  below,  will  not  be  available  or  develop  at  the  pace  or  in  the  manner expected by current net-zero scenarios. The success of our strategy for the energy transition will also depend on our ability to recognize key  signposts  of  changes  in  the  global  energy  system  on  a  timely  basis,  and  our  corresponding  ability  to  direct  investment  to  the technologies and businesses, at the appropriate stage of development, to best capitalize on our competitive strengths.",

Greenhouse  gas  restrictions. Government  actions  intended  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  include  adoption  of  cap  and  trade regimes, carbon taxes, carbon-based import duties or other trade tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, restrictive permitting, increased  mileage  and  other  efficiency  standards,  mandates  for  sales  of  electric  vehicles,  mandates  for  use  of  specific  fuels  or technologies,  and  other  incentives  or  mandates  designed  to  support  certain  technologies  for  transitioning  to  lower-emission  energy sources.  Political  and  other  actors  and  their  agents  also  increasingly  seek  to  advance  climate  change  objectives  indirectly,  such  as  by seeking to reduce the availability or increase the cost of financing and investment in the oil and gas sector. These actions include delaying or  blocking  needed  infrastructure,  utilizing  shareholder  governance  mechanisms  against  companies  or  their  shareholders  or  financial institutions in an effort to deter investment in oil and gas activities, and taking other actions intended to promote changes in business strategy  for  oil  and  gas  companies.  Depending  on  how  policies  are  formulated  and  applied,  such  policies  could  negatively  affect  our investment returns, make our hydrocarbon-based products more expensive or less competitive, lengthen project implementation times, and  reduce  demand  for  hydrocarbons,  as  well  as  shift  hydrocarbon  demand  toward  relatively  lower-carbon  alternatives.

Achieving societal ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately achieve net zero will require new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources, as well as technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS technologies, focused initially on capturing and sequestering CO2 emissions from high- intensity industrial activities, can assist in meeting society’s objective to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas levels while also helping ensure  the  availability  of  the  reliable  and  affordable  energy  the  world  requires.  ExxonMobil  has  established  a  Low  Carbon  Solutions (LCS) business unit to advance the development and deployment of these technologies and projects, including CCS, hydrogen, lower- emission  fuels,  and  lithium,  breakthrough  energy  efficiency  processes,  advanced  energy-saving  materials,  and  other  technologies.  The company’s  efforts  include  both  in-house  research  and  development  as  well  as  collaborative  efforts  with  leading  universities  and  with commercial partners involved in advanced lower-emission energy technologies. Our future results and ability to grow our LCS business, help nations meet their emission-reduction goals, and succeed through the energy transition will depend in part on the success of these research  and  collaboration  efforts  and  on  our  ability  to  adapt  and  apply  the  strengths  of  our  current  business  model  to  providing  the energy products of the future in a cost-competitive manner.",

Policy  and  market  development. The  scale  of  the  world’s  energy  system  means  that,  in  addition  to  developments  in  technology  as discussed above, a successful energy transition will require appropriate support from governments and private participants throughout the global  economy.  Our  ability  to  develop  and  deploy  CCS  and  other  lower-emission  energy  technologies  at  commercial  scale,  and  the growth and future returns of LCS and other emerging businesses in which we invest, will depend in part on the continued development of supportive government policies and markets. Failure or delay of these policies or markets to materialize or be maintained could adversely impact  these  investments.  Policy  and  other  actions  that  result  in  restricting  the  availability  of  hydrocarbon  products  without commensurate reduction in demand may have unpredictable adverse effects, including increased commodity price volatility; periods of significantly higher commodity prices and resulting inflationary pressures; and local or regional energy shortages. Such effects in turn may depress economic growth or lead to rapid or conflicting shifts in policy by different actors, with resulting adverse effects on our businesses. In addition, the existence of supportive policies in any jurisdiction is not a guarantee that those policies will continue in the future.

The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition. For projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control. Exploration and development program.

Project and portfolio management. The long-term success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream and Product Solutions businesses, as well as the future success of LCS and other emerging lower-emission investments, depends on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects. These projects  in  turn  require  a  high  degree  of  project  management  expertise  to  maximize  efficiency.  Specific  factors  that  can  affect  the performance  of  major  projects  include  our  ability  to:  negotiate  successfully  with  joint  venturers,  partners,  governments,  suppliers, customers,  or  others;  model  and  optimize  reservoir  performance;  develop  markets  for  project  outputs,  whether  through  long-term contracts or the development of effective spot markets; qualify for certain incentives available under supportive government policies for emerging  markets  and  technologies;  manage  changes  in  operating  conditions  and  costs,  including  costs  of  third  party  equipment  or services such as drilling rigs and shipping, supply-chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures; prevent, to the extent possible, and respond  effectively  to  unforeseen  technical  difficulties  that  could  delay  project  start-up  or  cause  unscheduled  project  downtime;  and influence the performance of project operators where ExxonMobil does not perform that role. In addition to the effective management of individual projects, ExxonMobil’s success, including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders, depends on our  ability  to  successfully  manage  our  overall  portfolio,  including  diversification  among  types  and  locations  of  our  projects,  products produced, and strategies to acquire or divest assets. We may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategies.

Preparedness. Our  operations  may  be  disrupted  by  severe  weather  events,  natural  disasters,  human  error,  and  similar  events.  For example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas. Our facilities are designed, engineered, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety factors built in to cover a number of uncertainties, including those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and earthquakes. Our consideration of  changing  weather  conditions  and  inclusion  of  safety  factors  in  design  covers  the  engineering  uncertainties  that  climate  change  and other events may potentially introduce. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering, our rigorous disaster preparedness and response, and business continuity planning. Insurance limitations. The ability of the Corporation to insure against many of the risks it faces as described in this Item 1A is limited by the availability and cost of coverage, which may not be economic, as well as the capacity of the applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient. Competition. As noted in Item 1 above, the energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. We face competition not only from other private firms, but also from state-owned companies that are increasingly competing for opportunities outside of their home countries and as partners with other private firms. In some cases, these state-owned companies may pursue opportunities in furtherance of strategic objectives of their government owners, with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders, such as ExxonMobil. Technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may also enhance the competitiveness of firms that may  not  have  the  internal  resources  and  capabilities  of  ExxonMobil  or  reduce  the  need  for  resource-owning  countries  to  partner  with private-sector oil and gas companies in order to monetize national resources.

The Corporation’s cybersecurity program is managed by the Corporation’s Vice President of IT, with support from cross-functional teams led  by  ExxonMobil  information  technology  (IT)  and  operational  technology  (OT)  cybersecurity  operations  managers  (collectively, Cybersecurity  Operations  Managers).  The  Cybersecurity  Operations  Managers  are  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  management  and effective  functioning  of  the  cybersecurity  program,  including  the  prevention,  detection,  investigation,  and  response  to  cybersecurity threats and incidents. The Cybersecurity Operations Managers collectively have many years of experience in cybersecurity operations. IT management provides regular reports to the Corporation’s senior management throughout the year, and to the Audit Committee or the Board  of  Directors,  as  appropriate,  in  its  annual  cybersecurity  review.  Such  reports  typically  address,  among  other  things,  the Corporation’s  cybersecurity  strategy,  initiatives,  key  security  metrics,  penetration  testing  and  benchmarking  learnings,  and  business response plans as well as the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.",

(1) In  the  preceding  reserves  information,  consolidated  subsidiary  and  equity  company  reserves  are  reported  separately.  However,  the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; international trade patterns and relations; and other factors described in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\". The estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir  pressures.  Furthermore,  the  Corporation  only  records  proved  reserves  for  projects  which  have  received  significant  funding commitments  by  management  toward  the  development  of  the  reserves.  Although  the  Corporation  is  reasonably  certain  that  proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation’s capital spending and also impact our partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects. Additions  to  ExxonMobil’s  proved  reserves  in  2023  were  based  on  estimates  generated  through  the  integration  of  available  and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.",

Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages. In  some  circumstances,  where  appropriate  analog  reservoirs  were  available,  reservoir  parameters  from  these  analogs  were  used  to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. ExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves and Resources group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with Securities and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  rules  and  regulations,  review  of  annual  changes  in  reserves  estimates,  and  the  reporting  of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The current Global Reserves and Resources Manager has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in Engineering, and served on the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines.

At year-end 2023, approximately 6.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped.  This  represents  37  percent  of  the  16.9  GOEB  reported  in  proved  reserves.  This  compares  to  6.6  GOEB  of  proved undeveloped  reserves  reported  at  the  end  of  2022.  During  the  year,  ExxonMobil  conducted  development  activities  that  resulted  in  the transfer  of  approximately  0.8  GOEB  from  proved  undeveloped  to  proved  developed  reserves  by  year-end.  The  largest  transfers  were related  to  development  activities  in  the  United  States,  Guyana,  Australia,  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates.  In  2023,  extensions  and discoveries,  primarily  in  the  United  States  and  Guyana,  resulted  in  the  addition  of  approximately  1.1  GOEB  of  proved  undeveloped reserves.  Also,  the  Corporation  reclassified  approximately  0.6  GOEB  of  proved  undeveloped  reserves  which  no  longer  met  the  SEC definition of proved reserves, primarily in the United States. Overall,  investments  of  $14.6  billion  were  made  by  the  Corporation  during  2023  to  progress  the  development  of  reported  proved undeveloped reserves, including $14.3 billion for oil and gas producing activities, along with additional investments for other non-oil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities. These investments represented 74 percent of the $19.8 billion in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures.",

These investments represented 74 percent of the $19.8 billion in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures. One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved undeveloped reserves in Australia, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The Corporation is reasonably certain that these  proved  reserves  will  be  produced;  however,  the  timing  and  amount  recovered  can  be  affected  by  a  number  of  factors  including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. In Australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the Gorgon Jansz LNG  project.  In  Kazakhstan,  the  proved  undeveloped  reserves  are  related  to  the  remainder  of  the  Tengizchevroil  joint  venture development that includes a production license in the Tengiz - Korolev field complex. The Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. In the United Arab Emirates,  proved  undeveloped  reserves  are  associated  with  an  approved  development  plan  and  continued  drilling  investment  for  the producing Upper Zakum field. A.

(1) ExxonMobil’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks, and leases. The terms and  conditions  under  which  the  Corporation  maintains  exploration  and/or  production  rights  to  the  acreage  are  property-specific, contractually  defined,  and  vary  significantly  from  property  to  property.  Work  programs  are  designed  to  ensure  that  the  exploration potential  of  any  property  is  fully  evaluated  before  expiration.  In  some  instances,  the  Corporation  may  elect  to  relinquish  acreage  in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation. Oil  and  gas  exploration  and  production  rights  are  acquired  from  mineral  interest  owners  through  a  lease.  Mineral  interest  owners include the Federal and State governments, as well as private mineral interest owners. Leases typically have a primary term ranging from  one  to  10  years,  and  a  production  period  beyond  the  primary  term  that  normally  remains  in  effect  until  production  ceases. Under certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its primary term even if production has not commenced. In some instances regarding private property, a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright.",

In some instances regarding private property, a “fee interest” is acquired where the underlying mineral interests are owned outright. Exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. These licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases upon completing specified work. In general, these license and  lease  agreements  are  held  as  long  as  there  is  proven  production  capability  on  the  licenses  and  leases.  Offshore  exploration licenses are generally held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. Offshore production licenses are valid for 25 years, with rights of extension for continued production. Significant discovery licenses in the offshore relating to currently undeveloped discoveries do not have a definite term. The  Federal  Hydrocarbon  Law  was  amended  in  2014.  Pursuant  to  the  amended  law,  the  production  term  for  an  onshore unconventional concession is 35 years and 25 years for a conventional concession, with unlimited 10-year extensions possible once a field has been developed. In 2019, the government granted three offshore exploration licenses, with terms of eight years, divided into two exploration periods of four years, with an optional extension of five years for each license. The  exploration  and  production  of  oil  and  gas  are  governed  by  concession  contracts  and  production  sharing  contracts  (PSCs). Concession contracts provide for an exploration period of up to eight years and a production period of 27 years. PSCs provide for an exploration period of up to seven years and a production period of up to 28 years. The Petroleum Activities Act 2023 authorizes the Government of Guyana to license and enter petroleum agreements for petroleum exploration, development, production, and storage operations. The Act enables petroleum agreements to provide for an exploration period to be established by subsidiary legislation by the Minister (typically up to 10 years) and provide for a production period of 20 years for an oil field and 30 years for a gas field, each with a renewal period of up to 10 years. Exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions up to three years each. Extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments. Production licenses were historically granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions subject to production on the license.",

Extensions are subject to specific minimum work commitments. Production licenses were historically granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple possible extensions subject to production on the license. Under the Mining Law, effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. The term is based on the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is issued. License conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the Mining Law. Production rights granted prior to January 1, 2003, remain subject to their existing terms and differ slightly for onshore and offshore areas. Onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite; from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. Offshore production licenses issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to 40 years. Acreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of  the  initial  term,  subject  to  extension  for  a  further  40  years.  At  the  end  of  any  such  40-year  term,  licenses  may  continue  in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate in all other areas. The majority of traditional licenses currently issued have an initial exploration term of four years with a second term extension of four years, and a final production term of 18 years, with  a  mandatory  relinquishment  of  50  percent  of  the  acreage  after  the  initial  term  and  of  all  acreage  that  is  not  covered  by  a development plan at the end of the second term. Exploration and production activities are governed by either production sharing agreements or other contracts with initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, and the agreements generally provide for negotiated extensions.",

Exploration  and  production  activities  are  generally  governed  by  concession  contracts  with  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of Mozambique,  represented  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy.  An  interest  in  Area  4  offshore  Mozambique  was acquired  in  2017.  Terms  for  Area  4  are  governed  by  the  Exploration  and  Production  Concession  Contract  (EPCC)  for  Area  4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area. In 2018, an interest was acquired in Area 5 offshore blocks A5-B, Z5-C, and Z5-D. Blocks Z5-C and Z5-D were relinquished in 2022. In 2023, the initial exploration phase expired on block A5-B, resulting in a relinquishment of the remaining Area 5 acreage. Exploration and production activities in the deepwater offshore areas are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL). NNPCL typically holds the underlying license or lease. The terms of the PSCs are generally 30 years (comprised of a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period).",

Operations under these pre-1969 Oil Mining Leases are conducted under a joint venture agreement with NNPCL rather than a PSC. Commercial terms applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the Petroleum Profits Tax Act. The 2021 Petroleum Industry Act will govern any further renewals to the term of the PSCs, licenses, or leases. The production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field was established for an initial period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994.

Development and production activities in the state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. An ExxonMobil affiliate entered into a contract with Basra Oil Company of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil for the rights to participate in the development and production activities of the West Qurna Phase I oil and gas field effective March 1, 2010. The term of the contract is 20 years with the right to extend for a period of five to 15 years. The contract provides for cost recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above specified levels. In early 2024, ExxonMobil closed on the sale of its remaining interest resulting in a full exit from the country. Onshore  exploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  the  production  license,  exploration  license,  and  joint  venture agreements  negotiated  with  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan.  Existing  production  operations  have  a  40-year  production  period  that commenced in 1993. Offshore  exploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  a  production  sharing  agreement  negotiated  with  the  Republic  of Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes development, is 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of two 10- year extensions. Production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have production terms of 25 years.

An  interest  in  the  development  and  production  activities  of  the  offshore  Upper  Zakum  field  was  acquired  in  2006.  In  2017,  the governing agreements were extended to 2051. Exploration and production activities conducted offshore in Commonwealth waters are governed by Federal legislation. Exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year renewal periods. Retention leases may be granted for resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application but are likely to become commercially viable within 15 years. These are granted for periods of five years, and renewals may be requested. Prior to July 1998, production licenses were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and thereafter indefinitely, i.e., for the life of the field. Effective from July 1998,  new  production  licenses  are  granted  indefinitely.  In  each  case,  a  production  license  may  be  terminated  if  no  production operations have been carried on for five years.

These definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation. Cash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources of cash both from operating the Corporation’s assets and from the divesting of assets. The Corporation employs  a  long-standing  and  regular  disciplined  review  process  to  ensure  that  assets  are  contributing  to  the  Corporation’s  strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular  nature  of  this  activity,  we  believe  it  is  useful  for  investors  to  consider  proceeds  associated  with  asset  sales  together  with  cash provided  by  operating  activities  when  evaluating  cash  available  for  investment  in  the  business  and  financing  activities,  including shareholder distributions.

The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual  segment  in  a  given  quarter  may  be  less  than  $250  million  when  the  item  impacts  several  segments  or  several  periods. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends, and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.",

In  addition,  ExxonMobil  considers  a  range  of  scenarios  -  including  remote  scenarios  -  to  help  inform  perspective  of  the  future  and enhance strategic thinking over time. Included in the range of these scenarios are the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Likely  Below  2°C  scenarios  and  three  scenarios  from  the  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA):  IEA  Stated  Policies  Scenario  (STEPS), which reflects a sector-by-sector assessment of current policy in place or announced by governments; IEA Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which reflects aspirational government targets met on time and in full; and IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), which  the  IEA  describes  as  extremely  challenging,  acknowledging  that  society  is  not  currently  on  the  IEA  NZE  pathway.  No  single transition  pathway  can  be  reasonably  predicted,  given  the  wide  range  of  uncertainties.

Using  our  own  experts  and  third-party  sources,  we  monitor  a  variety  of  signposts  that  may  indicate  a  potential  shift  in  the  energy transition. For example, the regional pace of the transition could be influenced by the cost of new technologies compared to existing or alternative energy sources. To effectively evaluate the pace of change, ExxonMobil uses many scenarios to help identify signposts that provide leading indicators of future developments and allow for timely adjustments to future versions of the Outlook.

Coincident  with  this  population  increase,  the Outlook  projects  worldwide  economic  growth  to  average  approximately  2.5 percent  per  year,  with  economic  output  growing  by  around  110  percent  by  2050 compared  to  2021.  As  economies  and  populations  grow,  and  as  living  standards improve for billions of people, the need for energy is expected to continue to rise. Even with significant efficiency gains, global energy demand is projected to rise by almost 15 percent from 2021 to 2050. This increase in energy demand is expected to be driven by developing countries (i.e., those that are not member nations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)). As  expanding  prosperity  drives  global  energy  demand  higher,  increasing  use  of energy-efficient technologies and practices as well as lower-emission products will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions per unit of economic output over time. Substantial efficiency gains are likely in all key aspects  of  the  world’s  economy  through  2050,  affecting  energy  requirements  for power  generation,  transportation,  industrial  applications,  and  residential  and commercial needs. Under  our  Outlook,  global  electricity  demand  is  expected  to  increase  about  80  percent  from  2021  to  2050,  with  developing  countries likely to account for over 75 percent of the increase. Consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to remain the largest and fastest growing major segment of global primary energy demand, supported by a wide variety of energy sources. The share of coal- fired generation is expected to decline substantially to approximately 15 percent of the world’s electricity in 2050, versus approximately",

The share of coal- fired generation is expected to decline substantially to approximately 15 percent of the world’s electricity in 2050, versus approximately 35 percent in 2021, in part due to policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address risks related to climate change. From 2021 to 2050, the amount of electricity supplied using natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables is expected to more than double, accounting for the entire growth in electricity supplies and offsetting the reduction of coal. Electricity from wind and solar is expected to increase more than 550 percent, helping total renewables (including other sources, e.g., hydropower) to account for over 80 percent of the increase in electricity supplies through 2050. Total renewables are expected to reach about 50 percent of global electricity supplies by 2050. Natural gas and nuclear are expected to be about 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of global electricity supplies  by  2050.  Supplies  of  electricity  by  energy  type  will  reflect  significant  differences  across  regions  reflecting  a  wide  range  of factors, including the cost and availability of various energy supplies and policy developments. Energy for transportation - including cars, trucks, ships, trains, and airplanes - is expected to increase by over 30 percent from 2021 to 2050. Transportation energy demand is expected to account for more than 60 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide over this period. Light-duty vehicle demand for liquid fuels is projected to peak by around 2025, and then decline to levels seen in the early-2000s by 2050, as the impact of better fuel economy and significant growth in electric cars, led by China, Europe, and the United States, work to offset growth in the worldwide car fleet of almost 70 percent. By 2050, light-duty vehicles are expected to account for around 15 percent of global liquid fuels demand. During the same time period, nearly all the world’s commercial transportation fleets are expected to continue to run on liquid fuels, including biofuels, which are expected to be widely available and offer practical advantages in providing a large quantity of energy in small volumes.",

Natural gas is a lower-emission, versatile, and practical fuel for a wide variety of applications. It is expected to grow the most of any primary  energy  type  from  2021  to  2050,  meeting  about  40  percent  of  global  energy  demand  growth.  Global  natural  gas  demand  is expected to rise nearly 25 percent from 2021 to 2050, with greater than 75 percent of that increase coming from the Asia Pacific region. Significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas - the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock formations - will help meet these needs. In total, about 50 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies is expected to come from unconventional sources. At the same time, conventionally-produced  natural  gas  is  likely  to  remain  the  cornerstone  of  global  supply,  meeting  around  two-thirds  of  worldwide demand in 2050.

Oil is expected to continue as the largest source of energy with its share remaining close to 30 percent in 2050. Coal and natural gas are the next largest sources of energy today, with the share of natural gas growing to more than 25 percent by 2050, while the share of coal falls to about half that of natural gas. Nuclear power is projected to grow, as many nations are likely to expand nuclear capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and environmental issues. Total renewable energy is expected to exceed 20 percent of global energy by 2050, with other renewables (e.g., biomass, hydropower, geothermal) contributing a combined share of more than 10 percent. Total energy supplied from wind and solar is expected to increase rapidly, growing over 500 percent from 2021 to 2050, when they are projected to be around 10 percent of the world energy mix. Decarbonization of industrial activities will require a suite of nascent or future lower-carbon technologies and supporting policies. Lower- emission fuels, hydrogen-based fuels, and carbon capture and storage are three key lower-carbon solutions needed to support a lower- emission future, in addition to wind and solar. Along with electrification, lower-emission fuels are expected to play an important role in decarbonization of the transportation sector, particularly in hard-to-decarbonize areas, such as aviation. Low-carbon hydrogen will be a key enabler replacing traditional furnace fuel to decarbonize the industrial sector. Hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels like ammonia are also expected to make inroads into commercial transportation as technology improves to lower its cost and policy develops to support the needed infrastructure development. Carbon capture and storage on its own, or in combination with hydrogen production, is among the few proven technologies that could enable CO2 emission reductions from high-emitting and hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as power generation and heavy industries, including manufacturing, refining, and petrochemicals.

International  accords  and  underlying  regional  and  national  regulations  covering  greenhouse  gas  emissions  continue  to  evolve  with uncertain timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact. For many years, the Corporation has taken into account policies established to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term Outlook. The climate accord reached at the 2015 Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. Our Outlook reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the successful achievement of the global aggregation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted by the nations that are signatories to the Paris Agreement, as available at the end of 2022. We have assumed success of these NDCs, despite the 2023 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report projecting that the G20 members will fall short of their NDCs. Our Outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate-related government policies, which often target specific sectors. For purposes of the Outlook, a proxy cost on energy-related CO2 emissions is assumed, based on regional considerations and relative levels of economic development, and by 2050, reaches up to $150 per metric ton for OECD nations and up to $100 per metric ton for non-OECD nations. China and other leading non-OECD nations are expected to trail OECD policy initiatives. Nevertheless, as people and nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will continue to need  practical  solutions  that  do  not  jeopardize  the  affordability  or  reliability  of  the  energy  they  need.  The  Corporation  continues  to monitor the updates to the NDCs that nations provided around COP 28 in Dubai in 2023, as well as other policy developments in light of net-zero ambitions formulated by some nations.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies in the industry invested below the levels needed to maintain or increase production capacity  to  meet  anticipated  demand.  During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  this  decline  in  investments  accelerated  as  industry  revenue collapsed resulting in underinvestment and supply tightness as demand for petroleum and petrochemical products recovered. In addition, industry rationalization of refining assets resulted in more than 3 million barrels per day of capacity being taken offline. These reductions, along  with  supply  chain  constraints  and  a  continuation  of  demand  recovery,  led  to  a  steady  increase  in  oil  and  natural  gas  prices  and refining margins through 2022. Energy markets began to normalize in 2023, down from their 2022 highs. During the first half of 2023, the price of crude oil declined towards  the  average  of  the  pre-COVID  10-year  range  (2010-2019),  impacted  by  higher  inventory  levels.  In  the  second  half,  crude  oil prices increased modestly from strong demand and ongoing actions by OPEC+ oil producers to limit supply. In the first nine months of the year, natural gas prices declined significantly with storage levels increasing above historical averages in the United States and Europe on higher supply and lower demand. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices improved as higher heating demand in the U.S. and supply interruptions in Europe and Asia brought prices back above the 10-year range. Throughout 2023, refining margins declined on easing supply concerns with stabilization of Russian supply. Strong demand for gasoline and  distillate,  combined  with  low  inventories,  kept  refining  margins  above  the  10-year  range  until  the  fourth  quarter  when  refining margins settled near the middle of the 10-year range due to lower seasonal demand.

Organizational  changes  implemented  over  the  past  several  years  enabled  the  Corporation  to  capture  $9.7  billion  of  structural  cost savings versus  2019,  including  $2.3  billion  of  savings  during  2023,  through  increased  operational  efficiencies  and  reduced  staffing costs.  The  company  sees  additional  opportunities  in  areas  such  as  supply  chain  efficiency,  improved  maintenance  and  turnarounds, modernized data management, and simplified business processes. These savings are key drivers for further improving the earnings power of the Corporation. (1)",

These savings are key drivers for further improving the earnings power of the Corporation. (1) The  Corporation  holds  a  25  percent  interest  in  Tengizchevroil,  LLP  (TCO),  which  operates  the  Tengiz  and  Korolev  oil  fields  in Kazakhstan, and a 16.8 percent working interest in the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan. Oil production from those operations is exported through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which the Corporation holds a 7.5 percent interest. CPC traverses parts of Kazakhstan and  Russia  to  tanker-loading  facilities  on  the  Russian  coast  of  the  Black  Sea.  In  the  event  geopolitical  issues  escalate  in  the  region, including ongoing military conflict, it is possible that the transportation of Kazakhstan oil through the CPC pipeline could be disrupted, curtailed,  temporarily  suspended,  or  otherwise  restricted.  In  such  a  case,  the  Corporation  could  experience  a  loss  of  cash  flows  of uncertain duration from its operations in Kazakhstan. For reference, after-tax earnings related to the Corporation’s interests in Kazakhstan in  2023  were  approximately  $2.0  billion,  and  its  share  of  combined  oil  and  gas  production  was  approximately  275  thousand  oil- equivalent barrels per day.

(1) On  October  6,  2022,  European  Union  (“EU”)  Member  States  adopted  an  EU  Council  Regulation  which,  along  with  other  measures, introduced a new tax described as an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. This regulation imposed a mandatory tax on certain companies active in the crude petroleum, coal, natural gas, and refinery sectors. The regulation required Member States to levy a minimum  33  percent  tax  on  in-scope  companies’  2022  and/or  2023  “surplus  profits\",  defined  in  the  regulation  as  taxable  profits exceeding 120 percent of the annual average profits during the 2018-2021 period. EU Member States were required to implement the tax, or an equivalent national measure, by December 31, 2022. The enactment of these regulations by Member States resulted in an after-tax charge  of  approximately  $1.8  billion  to  the  Corporation’s  fourth-quarter  2022  results  and  approximately  $0.2  billion  in  2023,  mainly reflected in the line “Income tax expense (benefit)” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Remaining cash payments are anticipated in the first half of 2024.

These strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational excellence, development of our employees, and investment in the communities in which we operate. The Upstream capital program continues to prioritize low cost-of-supply opportunities. ExxonMobil has a strong pipeline of development projects including continued growth in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as LNG expansion opportunities in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua  New  Guinea,  and  the  United  States.  As  future  development  projects  and  drilling  activities  bring  new  production  online,  the Corporation  expects  a  shift  in  the  geographic  mix  and  in  the  type  of  opportunities  from  which  volumes  are  produced.  Based  on  the current investment plans and merger with Pioneer, the proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. Currently about half of the Corporation's global production comes from unconventional, deepwater, and LNG resources. This proportion is generally expected to grow. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, the impact of fiscal and commercial terms, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing contracts, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment, international trade patterns and relations, and other factors described in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\". ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity, technology advances, consumer preference and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of OPEC and other large government resource owners, alternative energy sources, and other factors.",

Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. (1) Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease  royalty  burdens  and/or  volumes  attributable  to  ExxonMobil.  For  example,  at  higher  prices,  fewer  barrels  are  required  for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements. Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels as a result of production limits or sanctions imposed by governments. Divestments are  reductions  in  ExxonMobil’s  production  arising  from  commercial  arrangements  to  fully  or  partially  reduce  equity  in  a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.

This segment includes the fuels and aromatics value chains and catalysts and licensing. With the largest refining footprint among international oil companies, ExxonMobil’s Energy Products earnings are closely tied to industry refining margins. Refining margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials and the market prices for the products produced. Crude oil and many products are widely traded with  published  prices,  including  those  quoted  on  multiple  exchanges  around  the  world  (e.g.  New  York  Mercantile  Exchange  and Intercontinental Exchange). Prices for these commodities are determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many factors, including global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, industry refinery operations, import/export balances, currency fluctuations,  seasonal  demand,  weather,  and  political  considerations.  While  industry  refining  margins  significantly  impact  Energy Products  earnings,  strong  operations  performance,  product  mix  optimization,  and  disciplined  cost  control  are  also  critical  to  strong financial performance. In 2023, refining margins remained above the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010–2019) but started to normalize from their 2022 highs. Continued strong margins were supported by gasoline and distillate demand growth and relatively low inventory levels. Refining margins  will  remain  volatile  with  changes  in  global  factors  including  geopolitical  developments;  demand  growth;  recession  fears; inventory levels; and refining capacity utilizations, additions and rationalizations. Capacity  additions: The  company  started-up  its  Beaumont  Refinery  expansion  in  February  2023,  two  months  early,  and  reached nameplate crude distillation capacity of 250 thousand barrels per day in March. Strathcona Renewable Diesel project: In January 2023, ExxonMobil and its affiliates fully funded a project at Strathcona refinery to use  low-carbon  hydrogen,  locally-sourced  and  grown  feedstocks,  and  our  proprietary  catalyst  to  produce  20  thousand  barrels  of renewable diesel per day that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",

On December 31, 2023, the Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.3 billion and undrawn long-term lines of credit of $1.3 billion. To support cash flows in future periods, the Corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production. After a period of  production  at  plateau  rates,  it  is  the  nature  of  oil  and  gas  fields  to  eventually  produce  at  declining  rates  for  the  remainder  of  their economic life. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the Corporation’s key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time. Furthermore, the Corporation’s net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms. The  Corporation  has  long  been  successful  at  mitigating  the  effects  of  natural  field  decline  through  disciplined  investments  in  quality opportunities  and  project  execution.  The  Corporation  anticipates  several  projects  will  come  online  over  the  next  few  years  providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and international trade patterns and relations. The Corporation’s cash flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a more complete discussion of risks.",

Capital  and  exploration  expenditures  in 2023 were $26.3 billion, reflecting the Corporation’s continued active investment program. The Corporation plans to invest in the range of $23 billion to $25 billion in 2024. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. The Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall political and technical risks of the Corporation’s Upstream segment and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation’s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fixed commitments. The Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally,  the  Corporation  continues  to  evaluate  opportunities  to  enhance  its  business  portfolio  through  acquisitions  of  assets  or companies,  and  enters  into  such  transactions  from  time  to  time.  Key  criteria  for  evaluating  acquisitions  include  strategic  fit,  cost synergies, potential for future growth, low cost of supply, and attractive valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.",

In addition, the Corporation also enters into commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no fixed or minimum price) which are resold shortly after purchase, either in an active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts with similar  pricing  terms.  Examples  include  long-term,  noncancelable  LNG  and  natural  gas  purchase  commitments  and  commitments  to purchase  refinery  products  at  market  prices.  These  commitments  are  not  meaningful  in  assessing  liquidity  and  cash  flow,  because  the purchases will be offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. Take-or-pay obligations are noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services. Unconditional purchase obligations are those long-term  commitments  that  are  noncancelable  or  cancelable  only  under  certain  conditions,  and  that  third  parties  have  used  to  secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or services. These obligations mainly pertain to pipeline, manufacturing supply  and  terminal  agreements.  The  total  obligation  at  year-end  2023  for  take-or-pay  and  unconditional  purchase  obligations  was $44.3 billion. Cash payments expected in 2024 and 2025 are $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The  Corporation  and  certain  of  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  were  contingently  liable  at  December  31,  2023  for  guarantees  relating  to notes, loans and performance under contracts (Note 16). Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. Where it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation of the maximum potential amount of future payments, future performance is expected to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence. Guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 66",

The impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings have varied across the Corporation's operating segments. For the year 2024, a $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil would have approximately a $525 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity  company  earnings,  excluding  the  impact  of  derivatives.  Similarly,  a  $0.10  per  thousand  cubic  feet  change  in  the  worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $130 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, results of trading activities, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment lags  in  long-term  gas  contracts,  and  crude  and  gas  production  volumes.  Accordingly,  changes  in  benchmark  prices  for  crude  oil  and Consolidated subsidiaries. (1) natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period. In  the  very  competitive  petroleum  and  petrochemical  environment,  earnings  are  primarily  determined  by  margin  capture  rather  than absolute price levels of products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily  crude  oil)  and  the  market  prices  for  the  range  of  products  produced.  These  prices  in  turn  depend  on  global  and  regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations, import/export balances and weather. The global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the Corporation’s businesses.

Instead, where such sales  take  place,  they  are  the  result  of  efficiencies  and  competitive  advantages  of  integrated  refinery  and  chemical  complexes. Additionally,  intersegment  sales  are  at  market-based  prices.  The  products  bought  and  sold  between  segments  can  also  be  acquired  in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity, and transportation capabilities. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on intersegment revenue. Although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to global economic conditions, political events, decisions by OPEC and other major government resource owners and other factors, industry economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. The Corporation evaluates investments over a range of prices, including estimated greenhouse gas emission costs even in jurisdictions without a current greenhouse gas pricing policy.

The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity, and the complementary nature of its business segments reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates, and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based  contracts,  including  derivatives,  to  manage  commodity  price  risk  and  to  generate  returns  from  trading.  The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, or results  of  operations  for  the  years  ended  2023,  2022,  and  2021.  Credit  risk  associated  with  the  Corporation’s  derivative  position  is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. No material market or credit risks to the Corporation’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity exist as a result of the derivatives described in Note 13. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity. The Corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting the Corporation’s debt would not be material to earnings or cash flow.

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  Generally  Accepted  Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Corporation’s accounting policies are summarized in Note 1. The estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, development and production costs, and other factors. The estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the Corporation through long-standing approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves and Resources Group which has significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with  and  approval  by  senior  management.

Key features of the reserve estimation process are covered in Disclosure of Reserves in Item 2. Oil and natural gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves. • Proved  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves  are  determined  in  accordance  with  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC) requirements. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and operating conditions and government regulations. Proved reserves are determined using the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices during the reporting year. Proved reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves. Proved developed reserves include amounts which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves include amounts expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Proved undeveloped reserves are recognized only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that the reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances support a longer period of time. The Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced. However, the timing and amount recovered can be affected  by  a  number  of  factors  including  completion  of  development  projects,  reservoir  performance,  regulatory  approvals, government policy, consumer preferences, and significant changes in oil and natural gas price levels. • Unproved reserves are quantities of oil and natural gas with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and include probable reserves. Probable reserves are reserves that, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Revisions in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields can occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir, or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir, or production data, or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves.

Revisions can also result from significant changes in development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity. Oil  and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes  are  used  as  the  basis  to  calculate  unit-of-production  depreciation  rates  for  most  upstream  assets. Depreciation  is  calculated  by  taking  the  ratio  of  asset  cost  to  total  proved  reserves  or  proved  developed  reserves  applied  to  actual production.  The  volumes  produced  and  asset  cost  are  known,  while  proved  reserves  are  based  on  estimates  that  are  subject  to  some variability. In the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life. To the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of- production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes. The  Corporation  tests  assets  or  groups  of  assets  for  recoverability  on  an  ongoing  basis  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies, in part, on the Corporation’s planning and budgeting cycle.",

This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies, in part, on the Corporation’s planning and budgeting cycle. Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the future cash flows of these assets are predominantly based on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, development costs, and production costs. Significant reductions in the Corporation’s view of oil or natural gas commodity prices or margin ranges, especially the longer-term prices and margins, and changes in the development plans, including decisions to defer, reduce, or eliminate planned capital spending, can be an indicator of potential impairment. Other events or changes in circumstances, including indicators outlined in ASC 360, can be indicators of potential impairment as well. In general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices  over  the  long  term  must  be  sufficient  to  generate  investments  in  energy  supply  to  meet  global  demand.  Although  prices  will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC+ investment activities and production policies also  have  an  impact  on  world  oil  supplies.  The  demand  side  is  largely  a  function  of  general  economic  activities,  alternative  energy sources,  and  levels  of  prosperity.  During  the  lifespan  of  its  major  assets,  the  Corporation  expects  that  oil  and  gas  prices  and  industry margins will experience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings,  or  even  losses.  In  assessing  whether  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  value  of  an  asset  may  not  be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.",

Global Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the assumptions supporting the Corporate Plan is the Global Outlook (Outlook), which contains the Corporation’s demand and supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, economic development, and other factors. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of necessary future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology  advancements  emerge,  they  will  be  incorporated  into  the  Outlook,  and  the  Corporation’s  business  plans  will  be  updated accordingly.",

If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  and  are  consistent  with  the  criteria  management  uses  to  evaluate  investment opportunities.  These  evaluations  make  use  of  the  Corporation’s  assumptions  of  future  capital  allocations,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas commodity  prices  including  price  differentials,  refining  and  chemical  margins,  volumes,  development  and  operating  costs  including greenhouse  gas  emission  prices,  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  Notably,  when  assessing  future  cash  flows,  the  Corporation includes the estimated costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, including its goal of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin. Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management’s estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes  use  of  proved  reserve  quantities  and  may  include  risk-adjusted  unproved  reserve  quantities.  ExxonMobil  considers  a  range  of scenarios - including remote scenarios - to help inform perspective of the future and enhance strategic thinking over time. While third- party scenarios may be used for these purposes, they are not used as a basis for developing future cash flows for impairment assessments. As part of the Corporate Plan, the Company considers estimated greenhouse gas emission costs, even for jurisdictions without a current greenhouse gas pricing policy.",

Fair  Value  of  Impaired  Assets. An  asset  group  is  impaired  if  its  estimated  undiscounted  cash  flows  are  less  than  the  asset  group’s carrying value. Impairments are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of acreage values and flowing  production  metrics  from  comparable  market  transactions,  market-based  estimates  of  historical  cash  flow  multiples,  and discounted  cash  flows.  Inputs  and  assumptions  used  in  discounted  cash  flow  models  include  estimates  of  future  production  volumes, throughput  and  product  sales  volumes,  commodity  prices  (which  are  consistent  with  the  average  of  third-party  industry  experts  and government  agencies),  refining  and  chemical  margins,  drilling  and  development  costs,  operating  costs,  and  discount  rates  which  are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group. Other Impairment Estimates. Unproved properties are assessed periodically to determine whether they have been impaired. Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the Corporation's future development plans, the estimated economic chance of success, and the length of time that the Corporation expects  to  hold  the  properties.  Properties  that  are  not  individually  significant  are  aggregated  by  groups  and  amortized  based  on development risk and average holding period. Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the assets are considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Judgment is required to determine if assets are held for sale and to determine the fair value less cost to sell.",

Investments accounted for by the equity method are assessed for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that  the  carrying  value  of  an  investment  may  not  be  recoverable.  Examples  of  key  indicators  include  a  history  of  operating  losses, negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s business segment or geographic region. If the decline in value of the investment is other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value.

In 2023, the Corporation recognized after-tax charges of $3.4 billion, primarily related to the idled Upstream Santa Ynez Unit assets and associated facilities in California, which reflected the continuing challenges in the state regulatory environment that impeded  progress  towards  restoring  operations.  Other  impairments  in  the  year  included  a  $0.6  billion  charge  related  to  an  Upstream equity investment. In early 2022, in response to Russia’s military action in Ukraine, the Corporation announced that it planned to discontinue operations on the Sakhalin-1 project (“Sakhalin”) and develop steps to exit the venture. The Corporation’s first quarter 2022 results included after-tax charges  of  $3.0  billion  representing  the  impairment  of  its  Upstream  operations  related  to  Sakhalin.  (Refer  to  Note  2  for  further information on Russia.) During 2022, other after-tax impairment charges of $1.6 billion and $0.3 billion were recognized in Upstream and Energy Products, respectively. In  2021,  largely  as  a  result  of  changes  to  Upstream  development  plans,  the  Corporation  recognized  after-tax  impairment  charges  of approximately $1 billion.",

Factors which could put further assets at risk of impairment in the future include reductions in the Corporation’s price or margin outlooks, changes in the allocation of capital or development plans, reduced long-term demand for the Corporation's products, and operating cost increases which exceed the pace of efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural gas price or margin increases. However, due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity prices or margins, and the relationship between industry prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment charges related to the Corporation’s long-lived assets. For further information regarding impairments in equity method investments, property, plant, and equipment, and suspended wells, refer to Notes 7, 9, and 10, respectively. The Corporation is subject to retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation, technical assessments of the assets, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount rates, and inflation rates. See Note 9 for further information regarding asset retirement obligations. The  Corporation  continues  capitalization  of  exploratory  well  costs  when  it  has  found  a  sufficient  quantity  of  reserves  to  justify completion as a producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project.

The Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits footnote (Note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets, and pension expense. Some of these plans (primarily non-U.S.) provide pension benefits that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage advance funding. Book reserves are established for these plans. The portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is expensed as services are rendered.  The  portion  attributable  to  the  increase  in  pension  obligations  due  to  the  passage  of  time  is  expensed  over  the  term  of  the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. The primary difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund assets. For  funded  plans,  including  those  in  the  U.S.,  pension  obligations  are  financed  in  advance  through  segregated  assets  or  insurance arrangements. These plans are managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meet or exceed required funding levels as measured by relevant actuarial and government standards at the mandated measurement dates. In determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes. The  Corporation  will  continue  to  make  contributions  to  these  funded  plans  as  necessary.

Pension  accounting  requires  explicit  assumptions  regarding,  among  others,  the  long-term  expected  earnings  rate  on  fund  assets,  the discount rate for the benefit obligations, and the long-term rate for future salary increases. Pension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management. These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan assets in 2023 was 5.2 percent. The 10-year and 20-year actual returns on U.S. pension  plan  assets  were  5  percent  and  6  percent,  respectively.  The  Corporation  establishes  the  long-term  expected  rate  of  return  by developing  a  forward-looking,  long-term  return  assumption  for  each  pension  fund  asset  class,  taking  into  account  factors  such  as  the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. A worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $150 million before tax. Differences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year that  the  difference  occurs.  Such  differences  are  deferred,  along  with  other  actuarial  gains  and  losses,  and  are  amortized  into  pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.",

A variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be  reasonably  estimated.  For  contingencies  where  an  unfavorable  outcome  is  reasonably  possible  and  significant,  the  Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. As described in Note 16, for purposes of our contingency  disclosures,  “significant”  includes  material  matters,  as  well  as  other  matters,  which  management  believes  should  be disclosed.  Management  has  regular  litigation  reviews,  including  updates  from  corporate  and  outside  counsel,  to  assess  the  need  for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16. Management  judgment  is  required  related  to  contingent  liabilities  and  the  outcome  of  litigation  because  both  are  difficult  to  predict. However, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. In the Corporation’s experience, large claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement. The Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. The benefits of uncertain tax positions that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Significant management  judgment  is  required  in  the  accounting  for  income  tax  contingencies  and  tax  disputes  because  the  outcomes  are  often difficult to predict.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.

The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  include  the  accounts  of  subsidiaries  the  Corporation  controls  and  any  variable  interest  entities where it is deemed the primary beneficiary. They also include the Corporation’s share of the undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Amounts representing the Corporation’s interest in entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises  significant  influence,  are  included  in  “Investments,  advances  and  long-term  receivables”.  Under  the  equity  method  of accounting, the Corporation recognizes its share of the net income of these companies in “Income from equity affiliates”. Majority ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which subsidiaries are consolidated. However, certain factors may  indicate  that  a  majority-owned  investment  is  not  controlled  and,  therefore,  should  be  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  of accounting.  These  factors  occur  where  the  minority  shareholders  are  granted,  by  law  or  by  contract,  substantive  participating  rights. These include the right to approve operating policies, expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and management compensation and succession plans. Investments accounted for by the equity method are assessed for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that  the  carrying  value  of  an  investment  may  not  be  recoverable.  Examples  of  key  indicators  include  a  history  of  operating  losses, negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s business segment or geographic region. If the decline in value of the investment is other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. In the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash flows are used to assess fair value. The Corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment for equity method investments is reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income”.",

The Corporation’s share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment for equity method investments is reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income”. Investments  in  equity  securities,  other  than  consolidated  subsidiaries  and  equity  method  investments,  are  measured  at  fair  value  with changes  in  fair  value  recognized  in  net  income.  The  Corporation  uses  the  modified  approach  for  equity  securities  that  do  not  have  a readily determinable fair value. This modified approach measures investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions in a similar investment of the same issuer. The Corporation generally sells crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum and chemical products under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. In some cases (e.g., natural gas), products may be sold under long-term agreements, with periodic price adjustments to reflect market conditions. Revenue is recognized at the amount the Corporation expects to receive when the customer has taken control, which is typically when title transfers and the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership. The prices of certain sales are based on price indices that are sometimes not available until the next period. In such cases, estimated realizations are accrued when the sale is recognized, and are finalized when the price is available. Such adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods are not significant. Payment for revenue transactions is typically due within 30 days. Future volume delivery obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the period are expected to be fulfilled through ordinary production or purchases. These performance obligations are based on market prices at the time of the transaction and are fully constrained due to market price volatility. Purchases  and  sales  of  inventory  with  the  same  counterparty  that  are  entered  into  in  contemplation  of  one  another  are  combined  and recorded as exchanges measured at the book value of the item sold. “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Notes and accounts receivable” include revenue and receivables both within the scope of ASC",

Long-term  receivables  are  primarily  from receivables  outside  the  scope  of  ASC  606.  Contract  assets  are  mainly  from  marketing  assistance  programs  and  are  not  significant. Contract liabilities are mainly customer prepayments and accruals of expected volume discounts and are not significant.

The Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates that arise from existing assets, liabilities, firm commitments, and forecasted transactions.

Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively. Recognition  and  classification  of  the  gain  or  loss  that  results  from  adjusting  a  derivative  to  fair  value  depends  on  the  purpose  for  the derivative. All gains and losses from derivative instruments for which the Corporation does not apply hedge accounting are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the  gain  or  loss  from  the  derivative  instrument  is  initially  reported  as  a  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  and  subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Fair  value  is  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2, and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market. Crude oil, products, and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method – LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location. Selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.",

Selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less. Cost  Basis. The  Corporation  uses  the  “successful  efforts”  method  to  account  for  its  exploration  and  production  activities.  Under  this method,  costs  are  accumulated  on  a  field-by-field  basis.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property  (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and where the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other  exploratory  expenditures,  including  geophysical  costs  and  annual  lease  rentals,  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Development  costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized. Interest costs incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase of multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost  of  acquiring  the  constructed  assets.  The  project  construction  phase  commences  with  the  development  of  the  detailed  engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized interest costs are included in property, plant, and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets. Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit- of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life, taking obsolescence into consideration.",

Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  Capitalized  exploratory  drilling  and  development  costs  associated  with  productive  depletable  extractive properties  are  amortized  using  the  unit-of-production  rates  based  on  the  amount  of  proved  developed  reserves  of  oil  and  gas  that  are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods. Under the unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. In the event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life. To the extent that proved reserves for a property are substantially de-booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge does not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life, assets will be depreciated using a unit-of- production method based on reserves determined at the most recent SEC price which results in a more meaningful quantity of proved reserves, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes. Investments in refinery, chemical process, and lubes basestock manufacturing equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over  a  25-year  life.  Service  station  buildings  and  fixed  improvements  are  generally  depreciated  over  a  20-year  life.  Maintenance  and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred.

The  Corporation  tests  assets  or  groups  of  assets  for  recoverability  on  an  ongoing  basis  whenever  events  or changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amounts  may  not  be  recoverable.  Among  the  events  or  changes  in  circumstances which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following: • a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; • a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition, including a significant decrease in current and projected reserve volumes; • a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; • an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected; • a current-period operating loss combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and • a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. The Corporation has a robust process to monitor for indicators of potential impairment across its asset groups throughout the year. This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies, in part, on the Corporation’s planning and budgeting cycle. Asset valuation analysis, profitability reviews, and other periodic control processes assist the Corporation in assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable.",

Because the lifespans of the vast majority of the Corporation’s major assets are measured in decades, the future cash flows of these assets are predominantly based on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, development costs, and production costs. Significant reductions in the Corporation’s view of oil or natural gas commodity prices or margin ranges, especially the longer-term prices and margins, and changes in the development plans, including decisions to defer, reduce, or eliminate planned capital spending, can be an indicator of potential impairment. Other events or changes in circumstances can be indicators of potential impairment as well. In general, the Corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment. Management believes that prices  over  the  long  term  must  be  sufficient  to  generate  investments  in  energy  supply  to  meet  global  demand.  Although  prices  will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC investment activities and production policies also  have  an  impact  on  world  oil  supplies.  The  demand  side  is  largely  a  function  of  general  economic  activities,  alternative  energy sources,  and  levels  of  prosperity.  During  the  lifespan  of  its  major  assets,  the  Corporation  expects  that  oil  and  gas  prices  and  industry margins will experience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings,  or  even  losses.  In  assessing  whether  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  value  of  an  asset  may  not  be recoverable, the Corporation considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices and margins.",

In  the  Upstream,  the  standardized  measure  of  discounted  cash  flows  included  in  the  Supplemental  Information  on  Oil  and  Gas Exploration and Production Activities is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices in the year. These prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the Corporation’s price assumptions which are used for impairment assessments. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its oil and gas reserves, and therefore, does not consider it relevant in determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment assessment. Global  Outlook  and  Cash  Flow  Assessment. The  annual  planning  and  budgeting  process,  known  as  the  Corporate  Plan,  is  the mechanism  by  which  resources  (capital,  operating  expenses,  and  people)  are  allocated  across  the  Corporation.  The  foundation  for  the assumptions  supporting  the  Corporate  Plan  is  the  Global  Outlook  (Outlook),  which  contains  the  Corporation’s  demand  and  supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, economic development, and other factors. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of necessary future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and the Corporation’s business plans will be updated accordingly.",

As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and the Corporation’s business plans will be updated accordingly. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  and  are  consistent  with  the  criteria  management  uses  to  evaluate  investment opportunities.  These  evaluations  make  use  of  the  Corporation’s  assumptions  of  future  capital  allocations,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas commodity  prices  including  price  differentials,  refining  and  chemical  margins,  volumes,  development  and  operating  costs  including greenhouse  gas  emission  prices,  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  Notably,  when  assessing  future  cash  flows,  the  Corporation includes the estimated costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, including its goal of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin. Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management’s estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing  exclude  the  effects  of  derivative  instruments.  As  part  of  the  Corporate  Plan,  the  Company  considers  estimated  greenhouse  gas emission costs, even for jurisdictions without a current greenhouse gas pricing policy.",

Fair  Value  of  Impaired  Assets. An  asset  group  is  impaired  if  its  estimated  undiscounted  cash  flows  are  less  than  the  asset  group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of acreage values and flowing  production  metrics  from  comparable  market  transactions,  market-based  estimates  of  historical  cash  flow  multiples,  and discounted  cash  flows.  Inputs  and  assumptions  used  in  discounted  cash  flow  models  include  estimates  of  future  production  volumes, throughput  and  product  sales  volumes,  commodity  prices  (which  are  consistent  with  the  average  of  third-party  industry  experts  and government  agencies),  refining  and  chemical  margins,  drilling  and  development  costs,  operating  costs,  and  discount  rates  which  are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group. Other Impairments Related to Property, Plant and Equipment. Unproved properties are assessed periodically to determine whether they have been impaired. Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the Corporation's future development plans, the estimated economic chance of success, and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period. Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the assets are considered impaired and adjusted to the  lower  value.  Gains  on  sales  of  proved  and  unproved  properties  are  only  recognized  when  there  is  neither  uncertainty  about  the recovery of costs applicable to any interest retained nor any substantial obligation for future performance by the Corporation.",

The Corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates. Operations in the Product Solutions businesses use the local currency. However, the U.S. dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in Latin America) and in Singapore, which predominantly sells into the U.S. dollar export market. Upstream operations which are relatively self-contained and integrated within a particular country, such as in Canada and Europe, use the local currency. Some Upstream operations, primarily in Asia and Africa, use the U.S. dollar because they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into U.S. dollar-denominated markets.

In response to Russia’s military action in Ukraine, the Corporation announced in early 2022 that it planned to discontinue operations on the Sakhalin-1 project (“Sakhalin”) and develop steps to exit the venture. In light of this, an impairment assessment was conducted, and management determined that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. As a result, the Corporation’s first-quarter 2022 earnings  included  after-tax  charges  of  $3.4  billion  largely  representing  the  full  impairment  of  its  operations  related  to  Sakhalin.  On  a before-tax  basis,  the  charges  amounted  to  $4.6  billion,  substantially  all  of  which  is  reflected  in  the  line  captioned  “Depreciation  and depletion  (including  impairments)”  on  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income.  Effective  October  14,  2022,  the  Russian  government unilaterally terminated the Corporation’s interests in Sakhalin, transferring operations to a Russian operator. The Corporation’s fourth- quarter 2022 results include an after-tax benefit of $1.1 billion largely reflecting the impact of the expropriation on the company’s various obligations related to Sakhalin. The Corporation's exit from the project resulted in approximately 150 million oil-equivalent barrels no longer qualifying as proved reserves at year-end 2022. Research and development expenses totaled $879 million in 2023, $824 million in 2022, and $843 million in 2021.

(1) Government Assistance. ASC 832 \"Government Assistance\" requires disclosure of certain types of government assistance not otherwise covered by authoritative accounting guidance. During 2023 and 2022, certain governments outside the United States provided payments which,  individually  and  in  aggregate,  were  immaterial  to  the  Corporation's  financial  results.  Among  these  are  programs  where governments  endeavor  to  stabilize  or  cap  fuel  and  energy  costs  for  local  consumers.  To  compensate  producers  who  sell  at  the government-mandated prices, these governments provide reimbursements to the producers. In 2023 such reimbursements were negligible and in 2022 these reimbursements totaled approximately $1.5 billion before tax, which were reflected as reductions to the line captioned \"Crude oil and product purchases\" on the Consolidated Statement of Income. At December 31, 2022, \"Notes and accounts receivable - net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet included $0.5 billion related to pending government reimbursements. The terms and conditions of these programs, including their duration, vary by country. In the event that any of these programs are discontinued, the Corporation does not expect a significant impact to its financial results. Additionally, in connection with cap and trade programs in certain countries outside the United States, companies receive allowances from governments covering a specified level of emissions from facilities they operate. The terms of these programs vary by country. The Corporation records these allowances at a nominal amount, generally in \"Inventories - Crude oil, products and merchandise\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

Before-tax charges of $3.3 billion were recognized, in large part  due  to  impairing  the  idled  Upstream  Santa  Ynez  Unit  assets  and  associated  facilities  in  California,  reflecting  the  continuing challenges  in  the  state  regulatory  environment  that  impeded  progress  in  restoring  operations.  Other  before-tax  impairment  charges recognized during 2023 included $0.3 billion in Upstream, $0.3 billion in Chemical Products, and $0.1 billion in Specialty Products. In 2022, before-tax impairment charges of $4.5 billion were recognized during the first quarter as a result of the Corporation's plans to discontinue operations on the Sakhalin-1 project and develop steps to exit the venture in response to Russia's military action in Ukraine (Refer  to  Note  2  for  additional  information).  Other  before-tax  impairment  charges  recognized  during  2022  included  $1.5  billion  in Upstream and $0.4 billion in Energy Products.

In 2021, the Corporation recognized before-tax impairment charges of $1.2 billion largely as a result of changes to Upstream development plans. Impairment charges are primarily recognized in the lines “Depreciation and depletion” and “Exploration expenses, including dry holes” on  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income.  Accumulated  depreciation  and  depletion  totaled  $272,445  million  at  the  end  of  2023  and $268,001 million at the end of 2022. The  Corporation  incurs  retirement  obligations  for  certain  assets.  The  fair  values  of  these  obligations  are  recorded  as  liabilities  on  a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation, technical assessments of the assets,  estimated  amounts  and  timing  of  settlements,  discount  rates,  and  inflation  rates.  Asset  retirement  obligations  incurred  in  the current period were Level 3 fair value measurements. The costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated as the reserves are produced. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value. Asset  retirement  obligations  for  facilities  in  the  Product  Solutions  business  generally  become  firm  at  the  time  a  decision  is  made  to permanently  shut  down  and  dismantle  the  facilities.  These  obligations  may  include  the  costs  of  asset  disposal  and  additional  soil remediation. However, these sites generally have indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations and as such, the fair value of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured, since it is impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations.

Right of use assets and lease liabilities are established on the balance sheet for leases with an expected term greater than one year by discounting the amounts fixed in the lease agreement for the duration of the lease which is reasonably certain, considering the probability of  exercising  any  early  termination  and  extension  options.  The  portion  of  the  fixed  payment  related  to  service  costs  for  drilling equipment, tankers, and finance leases is excluded from the calculation of right of use assets and lease liabilities. Generally, assets are leased only for a portion of their useful lives and are accounted for as operating leases. In limited situations, assets are leased for nearly all of their useful lives and are accounted for as finance leases. Variable payments under these lease agreements are not significant. Residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants related to leases, and transactions with related parties are also not significant. In general, leases are capitalized using the incremental borrowing rate of the leasing affiliate. The Corporation’s activities as a lessor are not significant.

Derivative  Instruments. The  Corporation’s  size,  strong  capital  structure,  geographic  diversity,  and  the  complementary  nature  of  its business segments reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates, and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue” and in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in “Cash Flows from Operating Activities”. The  Corporation’s  commodity  derivatives  are  not  accounted  for  under  hedge  accounting.  At  times,  the  Corporation  also  enters  into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, or results of operations for 2023, 2022, and 2021. Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting, and monitoring of derivative activity.

Litigation. A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits.  Management  has  regular  litigation  reviews,  including  updates  from  corporate  and  outside  counsel,  to  assess  the  need  for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does  not  record  liabilities  when  the  likelihood  that  the  liability  has  been  incurred  is  probable  but  the  amount  cannot  be  reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes should be disclosed. State and local governments and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States and  its  territories  have  filed  a  number  of  legal  proceedings  against  several  oil  and  gas  companies,  including  ExxonMobil,  requesting unprecedented  legal  and  equitable  relief  for  various  alleged  injuries  purportedly  connected  to  climate  change.  These  lawsuits  assert  a variety  of  novel,  untested  claims  under  statutory  and  common  law.  Additional  such  lawsuits  may  be  filed.  We  believe  the  legal  and factual theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless and represent an inappropriate attempt to use the court system to usurp the proper role of policymakers in addressing the societal challenges of climate change.",

The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2023, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts.

Additional  European  Taxes  on  the  Energy  Sector. On  October  6,  2022,  European  Union  (“EU”)  Member  States  adopted  an  EU Council  Regulation  which,  along  with  other  measures,  introduced  a  new  tax  described  as  an  emergency  intervention  to  address  high energy  prices.  This  regulation  imposed  a  mandatory  tax  on  certain  companies  active  in  the  crude  petroleum,  coal,  natural  gas,  and refinery  sectors.  The  regulation  required  Member  States  to  levy  a  minimum  33  percent  tax  on  in-scope  companies’  2022  and/or  2023 “surplus profits\", defined in the regulation as taxable profits exceeding 120 percent of the annual average profits during the 2018-2021 period. EU Member States were required to implement the tax, or an equivalent national measure, by December 31, 2022. The enactment of these regulations by Member States resulted in an after-tax charge of approximately $1.8 billion to the Corporation’s fourth-quarter 2022  results  and  approximately  $0.2  billion  in  2023,  mainly  reflected  in  the  line  “Income  tax  expense  (benefit)”  on  the  Consolidated Statement of Income.

Unrecognized  Tax  Benefits. The  Corporation  is  subject  to  income  taxation  in  many  jurisdictions  around  the  world.  The  benefits  of uncertain  tax  positions  that  the  Corporation  has  taken  or  expects  to  take  in  its  income  tax  returns  are  recognized  in  the  financial statements  if  management  concludes  that  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  position  will  be  sustained  with  the  tax  authorities.  For  a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Unrecognized tax benefits reflect the difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on  income  tax  returns  and  the  amounts  recognized  in  the  financial  statements.  The  following  table  summarizes  the  movement  in unrecognized tax benefits:",

Unfavorable resolution of these tax positions generally would not increase the effective tax rate. The 2023, 2022, and 2021 changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Corporation’s net income. Resolution  of  these  tax  positions  through  negotiations  with  the  relevant  tax  authorities  or  through  litigation  will  take  many  years  to complete. It is difficult to predict the timing of resolution for these tax positions since the timing is not entirely within the control of the Corporation. Unlike 2022, during which litigation resolved certain unrecognized tax benefit positions, there was no major resolution of unrecognized  tax  benefit  positions  in  2023.  The  Corporation  has  various  U.S.  federal  income  tax  positions  at  issue  with  the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2010. Unfavorable resolution of these issues would not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations or financial condition. It  is  reasonably  possible  that  the  total  amount  of  unrecognized  tax  benefits  could  increase  by  up  to  20  percent  or  decrease  by  up  to 30 percent in the next 12 months.

For 2023, 2022, and 2021 the Corporation's net interest expense on income tax reserves was $60 million, $16 million, and $0 million, respectively. The related interest payable balances were $134 million and $63 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In  2023,  the  Corporation  realized  proceeds  of  approximately  $4.1  billion  and  recognized  net  after-tax  earnings  of  approximately $0.6  billion  from  its  divestment  activities.  This  included  the  sale  of  the  Aera  Energy  joint  venture,  Esso  Thailand  Ltd.,  the  Billings Refinery, certain unconventional assets in the United States, as well as other smaller divestments. In  2022,  the  Corporation  realized  proceeds  of  approximately  $5.2  billion  and  recognized  net  after-tax  earnings  of  approximately $0.4  billion  from  its  divestment  activities.  This  included  the  sale  of  certain  unproved  assets  in  Romania  and  unconventional  assets  in Canada and the United States, as well as other smaller divestments. In February 2022, the Corporation signed an agreement with Seplat Energy Offshore Limited for the sale of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited.  The  agreement  is  subject  to  certain  conditions  precedent  and  government  approvals.  In  early  July  2022,  a  Nigerian  court issued an order to halt transition activities and enter into arbitration with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company.

The closing date and any loss on sale will depend on resolution of these matters. On February 14, 2024, the Corporation closed the sale of the Santa Ynez Unit and associated facilities in California. The Corporation expects no material impacts on its first quarter 2024 financial statements. On November 2, 2023, the Corporation acquired Denbury, a developer of carbon capture, utilization, and storage solutions and enhanced oil  recovery  producing  assets.  The  acquisition  also  included  Gulf  Coast  and  Rocky  Mountain  oil  and  natural  gas  operations  which consisted  of  proved  reserves  totaling  approximately  0.2  billion  oil-equivalent  barrels  and  approximately  45  thousand  oil-equivalent barrels per day of production. Total  consideration  was  $5.1  billion,  which  included  the  issuance  of  46  million  shares  of  ExxonMobil  common  stock  from  treasury having a fair value of $4.8 billion on the acquisition date, and cash payments of $0.3 billion related to repayment of Denbury's credit facility and settlement of fractional shares. The  transaction  was  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination  in  accordance  with  ASC  805,  which  requires  that  assets  acquired  and liabilities  assumed  be  recognized  at  their  fair  values  as  of  the  acquisition  date.

On  October  11,  2023,  the  Corporation  announced  a  merger  agreement  with  Pioneer  Natural  Resources  Company  (Pioneer),  an independent  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  production  company,  in  exchange  for  ExxonMobil  common  stock.  Based  on  the  October  5 closing price for ExxonMobil shares, the fixed exchange rate of 2.3234 per Pioneer share, and Pioneer's outstanding net debt, the implied enterprise  value  of  the  transaction  was  approximately  $65  billion.  We  expect  the  number  of  shares  issuable  in  connection  with  the transaction  to  be  approximately  546  million.  The  transaction  is  expected  to  close  in  the  second  quarter  of  2024,  subject  to  regulatory approvals. Pioneer holds over 850 thousand net acres in the Midland Basin of West Texas, which consist of proved reserves totaling over 2.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (as of December 31, 2022) and over 700 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day of production for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The results of operations for producing activities shown below do not include earnings from other activities that ExxonMobil includes in the Upstream function, such as oil and gas transportation operations, LNG liquefaction and transportation operations, power operations, technical service agreements, gains and losses from derivative activity, other nonoperating activities and adjustments for noncontrolling interests. These excluded amounts for both consolidated and equity companies totaled $(519) million in 2023, $4,802 million in 2022 and $(1,380)  million  in  2021.

The definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate  expire,  unless  evidence  indicates  that  renewal  is  reasonably  certain.  In  some  cases,  substantial  new  investments  in  additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves. In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules, the Corporation’s year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of- the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows. Revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.",

Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity. Proved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate’s  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil’s  ownership percentage of the proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids. In the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies. Reserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil  and  natural  gas  price  changes.  As  oil  and  natural  gas  prices  increase,  the  cash  flow  and  value  received  by  the  company  increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices  decrease,  the  opposite  effect  generally  occurs.  The  percentage  of  total  proved  reserves  (consolidated  subsidiaries  plus  equity companies)  at  year-end  2023  that  were  associated  with  production  sharing  contract  arrangements  was  13  percent  on  an  oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels). Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.",

Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil’s oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes. The changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion oil- equivalent barrels (GOEB), asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition. The changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 GOEB, asset sales of 0.4 GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana. The changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries  of  approximately  1.3  GOEB  occurred  primarily  in  the  United  States  (0.9  GOEB),  Brazil  (0.2  GOEB)  and  Guyana  (0.1 GOEB).

(1) As required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices, year-end costs and legislated tax rates, and a discount factor of 10 percent to net proved reserves.  The  standardized  measure  includes  costs  for  future  dismantlement,  abandonment,  and  rehabilitation  obligations.  The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation’s expected future cash flows to be obtained  from  the  development  and  production  of  its  oil  and  gas  properties  or  of  the  value  of  its  proved  oil  and  gas  reserves.  The standardized measure is prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including first-day-of-the-month average prices, which represent discrete points in time and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year as prices change.",
