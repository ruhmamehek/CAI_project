*(Final Refined Outline — Clean, Focused, and Logically Flowing)*

---

### **1. Abstract (150–200 words)**

Concise summary of:

* Motivation (linguistic inequity, need for inclusivity).
* Scope (datasets, models, transfer, evaluation).
* Methods and trends (cross-lingual adaptation, instruction-tuning).
* Outlook (cultural grounding, sustainability).
  *(Write last.)*

---

### **2. Introduction & Motivation (~1 page)**

* Define *low-resource* and *multilingual* in the conversational AI context.
* Highlight linguistic imbalance (95% of languages lack dialogue data).
* Real-world relevance: assistants, education, civic services.
* Evolution: monolingual → cross-lingual → multilingual → instruction-tuned.
* **Contributions:**

  1. Comprehensive synthesis of multilingual dialogue methods (2019–2025).
  2. Taxonomy of cross-lingual transfer strategies.
  3. Comparative overview of dialogue datasets and evaluation frameworks.
  4. Discussion of cultural alignment, fairness, and sustainability.

### **3. Scope & Terminology Box (short boxed section)**

Clarify definitions and boundaries:

* Multilingual vs cross-lingual vs code-switched.
* Resource scarcity dimensions (data, compute, script coverage).
* Focus: *text-based dialogue models* (task-oriented + open-domain).
* Exclude: dedicated MT, ASR-only systems.

### **4. Related Surveys & Historical Context (0.5 page)**

* Summarize prior work: multilingual NLP (Conneau & Lample 2020), low-resource NLP (Joshi 2020), code-switching (Khanuja 2021).
* Identify novelty: dialogue-centric perspective, instruction-tuned LLM era, fairness evaluation.

### **5. Foundations of Multilingual Representation (~1 page)**

*(Technical core — no fairness overlap)*

* **Tokenization & Scripts:** subword vs byte-level, morphology in agglutinative/non-Latin languages.
* **Pretraining Paradigms:** mBERT, XLM-R, mBART, mT5, ByT5.
* **Objectives:** MLM, TLM, contrastive alignment.
* **Architectural Comparison:** encoder vs encoder-decoder vs byte-level.
* **Taxonomy Figure:** multilingual model families and objectives.
* Transition sentence → “These representations form the base for cross-lingual adaptation.”

### **6. Multilingual & Low-Resource Dialogue Datasets (~1.5 pages)**

* **Benchmark Table:** MTOP, MASSIVE, XPersona, XDialog, GLUECoS, XTREME-R.
* **Creation Paradigms:** translation, community curation, synthetic augmentation.
* **Quality & Coverage Challenges:** annotation consistency, domain skew.
* **Ethical Dimensions:** participatory collection (Masakhane, IndicNLP), data rights, licensing, cultural bias.

---

### **7. Cross-Lingual Adaptation & Transfer Techniques (~1.5 pages)**

* **Fine-Tuning Strategies:** zero-shot, translate-train/test, multilingual joint finetuning.
* **Parameter-Efficient Adaptation:** Adapters (MAD-X, BAD-X), LoRA, prefix/prompt tuning.
* **Representation Alignment:** LASER, LaBSE, InfoXLM, VECO; embedding visualization (t-SNE).
* **Failure Cases:** typological distance, script mismatch, translation noise.
* (Optional mini-table summarizing success/failure by language pair.)

### **8. Dialogue Modeling in Low-Resource Settings (~1 page)** -- Ruhma

* **Dialogue-Specific Fine-Tuning:** mT5-Dialog, Poly-encoder, mDialoGPT.
* **Data Augmentation:** back-translation, paraphrasing, cross-lingual bootstrapping.
* **Code-Switch Handling:** mixed-vocabulary, language tags, dynamic embeddings.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** slot-F1, BLEU, intent accuracy; GLUECoS, LINCE, HinglishEval.

---

### **9. Instruction-Tuning & LLM-Era Multilingual Chatbots (~1.5 pages)** -- Ruhma

* **Instruction-Tuned Models:** BLOOMZ, mT0, mT5-XXL, Aya, Yi-Intl.
* **Preference & Cultural Alignment:** Aya-Alignment, Multi-Alpaca.
* **Capabilities:** zero-shot following, unseen language generalization.
* **Limitations:** cultural misalignment, uneven coverage, safety gaps.
* **Trend Diagram:** progression from pretraining → instruction-tuning → alignment.

### **10. Evaluation, Fairness, & Safety (~1.5 pages)**

*(Behavioral and ethical evaluation — no architecture overlap)*

* **10.1 Benchmarks & Metrics:** XTREME, XWinograd, XSAFETY, Multi-HateCheck; BLEU, COMET, BLEURT, toxicity, value alignment.
* **10.2 Representation Fairness:** gender/religion bias in mBERT, XLM-R embeddings.
* **10.3 Human Evaluation:** rater bias, cross-lingual fluency issues, reproducibility checklists.
* **10.4 Cultural & Safety Aspects:** hallucination, multilingual toxicity, culturally unsafe responses.

---

### **11. Open Challenges & Future Directions (~1 page)**

* **True Low-Resource Languages:** scriptless or endangered dialects.
* **Evaluation Leakage:** test-train overlap in pretraining corpora.
* **Cultural Grounding:** participatory and community-driven evaluation.
* **Sustainability:** compute/energy equity, “Green NLP.”
* **Multimodal Extension (short outlook paragraph):**

  > Emerging speech–text models (Whisper, SeamlessM4T) and multimodal chat (Kosmos-2, Gemini) hint at multilingual dialogue beyond text, posing new evaluation and accessibility challenges.
