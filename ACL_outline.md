**Structure:**

* Context: Importance of multilingual and low-resource conversational AI.

* Closing: Roadmap for inclusive, culturally aware, and sustainable dialogue systems.

*(Write last after full draft.)*

### 🌍 **2. Introduction & Motivation (~1 page)**

* Define **“low-resource”** (limited data, compute, script coverage) and **“multilingual”** in dialogue AI.
* Contextualize inequality: 95%+ of world’s languages lack usable conversational datasets.
* Implications for chatbots, virtual assistants, and educational systems.
* Research evolution from monolingual → cross-lingual → multilingual dialogue systems.
* **Contributions:**

  1. Systematic synthesis of multilingual dialogue methods (2019–2025).
  2. Taxonomy of cross-lingual transfer approaches.
  3. Comparative analysis of multilingual datasets and evaluation.
  4. Discussion on cultural alignment, safety, and sustainability.

### 🧱 **3. Scope & Terminology Box (Optional Mini-Section)**

*A short boxed paragraph or table.*

* Clarify distinctions: multilingual vs cross-lingual vs multi-dialectal.
* Scope limits: focus on **text-based dialogue models** (task-oriented, chitchat, instruction-following).
* Exclusions: full machine translation, ASR-only systems.
* Definition criteria for “low-resource” (data size <100k dialogues, non-Latin scripts, etc.).

### 🕰 **4. Related Surveys & Historical Context (0.5 page)**

* Summarize prior surveys:

  * Multilingual pretraining (Conneau & Lample, 2020).
  * Low-resource NLP (Joshi et al., 2020).
