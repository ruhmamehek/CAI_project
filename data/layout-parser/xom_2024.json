Achieving societal ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately achieve net zero will require new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources, as well as technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS technologies, focused initially on capturing and sequestering CO2 emissions from high- intensity industrial activities, can assist in meeting society’s objective to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas levels while also helping ensure  the  availability  of  the  reliable  and  affordable  energy  the  world  requires.  ExxonMobil  has  established  a  Low  Carbon  Solutions (LCS) business unit to advance the development and deployment of these technologies and projects, including CCS, hydrogen, lower- emission  fuels,  and  lithium,  breakthrough  energy  efficiency  processes,  advanced  energy-saving  materials,  and  other  technologies.

ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved undeveloped reserves in Australia, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The Corporation is reasonably certain that these  proved  reserves  will  be  produced;  however,  the  timing  and  amount  recovered  can  be  affected  by  a  number  of  factors  including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. In Australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the Gorgon Jansz LNG  project.  In  Kazakhstan,  the  proved  undeveloped  reserves  are  related  to  the  remainder  of  the  Tengizchevroil  joint  venture development that includes a production license in the Tengiz - Korolev field complex.

ASC 832 \"Government Assistance\" requires disclosure of certain types of government assistance not otherwise covered by authoritative accounting guidance. During 2023 and 2022, certain governments outside the United States provided payments which,  individually  and  in  aggregate,  were  immaterial  to  the  Corporation's  financial  results.  Among  these  are  programs  where governments  endeavor  to  stabilize  or  cap  fuel  and  energy  costs  for  local  consumers.  To  compensate  producers  who  sell  at  the government-mandated prices, these governments provide reimbursements to the producers. In 2023 such reimbursements were negligible and in 2022 these reimbursements totaled approximately $1.5 billion before tax, which were reflected as reductions to the line captioned \"Crude oil and product purchases\" on the Consolidated Statement of Income. At December 31, 2022, \"Notes and accounts receivable - net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet included $0.5 billion related to pending government reimbursements. The terms and conditions of these programs, including their duration, vary by country. In the event that any of these programs are discontinued, the Corporation does not expect a significant impact to its financial results. Additionally, in connection with cap and trade programs in certain countries outside the United States, companies receive allowances from governments covering a specified level of emissions from facilities they operate. The terms of these programs vary by country. The Corporation records these allowances at a nominal amount, generally in \"Inventories - Crude oil, products and merchandise\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.","type":"Text"},{"left":536.0,"top":743.0,"width":58.0,"height":7.0,"page_number":145,"page_width":612,"page_height":792,"text":"Page 145 of 225","type":"Page footer"},{"left":17.0,"top":743.0,"width":157.0,"height":6.0,"page_number":145,"page_width":612,"page_height":792,"text":"file:///Users/isaaclo/Desktop/XOM_2024.html","type":"Page footer"},{"left":300.0,"top":575.0,"width":11.0,"height":9.0,"page_number":145,"page_width":612,"page_height":792,"text":"88","type":"Page footer"},{"left":534.0,"top":18.0,"width":59.0,"height":7.0,"page_number":146,"page_width":612,"page_height":792,"text":"11/17/25, 1 : 12 AM","type":"Page header"},{"left":18.0,"top":17.0,"width":52.0,"height":7.0,"page_number":146,"page_width":612,"page_height":792,"text":"xom-20231231","type":"Page header"},{"left":23.0,"top":49.0,"width":321.0,"height":13.0,"page_number":146,"page_width":612,"page_height":792,"text":"N OTES TO CO N SOLIDATED FI N A N CIAL STATEME N TS","type":"Section header"},{"left":23.0,"top":100.0,"width":239.0,"height":12.0,"page_number":146,"page_width":612,"page_height":792,"text":"4.

A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits.  Management  has  regular  litigation  reviews,  including  updates  from  corporate  and  outside  counsel,  to  assess  the  need  for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued.

For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes should be disclosed.
