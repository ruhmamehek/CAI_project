Under the proposal, changes to the framework would include replacement of the Advanced approach with an expanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of internal models for the calculation of RWA, other than for market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both the expanded risk- based approach and the Standardized approach. The proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based approach. Based on the Firm's understanding of the proposal, as applied to its Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023 (the reference date for a special data collection exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve), the estimated impact at the end of the transition period would increase RWA by approximately 30%, which would result in an approximately 25% increase to CET1 capital necessary to meet the Firm’s CET1 ratio requirement, all else equal. These estimates do not reflect any actions that the Firm may take to mitigate the impact of the rule as currently proposed.",

To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.",

The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $13.2 billion and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was predominantly driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on higher spend and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain reward program terms in the second quarter of 2023.",

Although the Firm believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and accruals.

The Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are determined based on the weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.",

The asset- specific component of the allowance for non-collateral dependent loans incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows including changes in interest rates, principal forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors.

The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity for reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values,",

All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements.

JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize.",

Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase evaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax benefits based on its anticipated tax return filing positions as part of its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for audit settlements make it reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by as much as approximately $1.1 billion. The change in the unrecognized tax benefit would result in a payment or income statement recognition.",

The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third- party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets.

Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred.

The Firm has completed enhancements to the CIB’s venue inventory and data completeness controls, and other remediation is underway. The Firm has also performed a review of the data not originally surveilled, which is nearly complete, and has not identified any employee misconduct, harm to clients or the market. While the identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall activity across the CIB, the data gap on one venue, which largely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was significant. The Firm is dedicated to maintaining rigorous controls and continuously enhancing the reliability of its trade infrastructure. The Firm expects to enter into resolutions with two U.S. regulators that will require the Firm to, among other things, complete its remediation, engage an independent consultant, and pay aggregate civil penalties of approximately $350 million.
