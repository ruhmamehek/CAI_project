In the EU, multiple directives and laws (including NIS2, EHDS, the Data Act, the Cyber Resilience Act, and the AI Act) are rapidly changing privacy and cybersecurity compliance requirements while introducing new enforcement risks. In addition, China has introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations, with more anticipated, thereby increasing China’s scrutiny of company compliance and data transfer practices. With other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force greater accountability on the collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry. These laws can also restrict transfers of data across borders, potentially impacting how data-driven health care solutions are developed and deployed globally in a compliant manner. Moreover, as a result of the broad scale release and availability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as generative AI, a global trend towards more comprehensive and nuanced regulation (e.g., White House’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence; the EU AI Act) to ensure the ethical use, privacy, and security of AI is underway that includes standards for transparency, accountability, and fairness, which will require compliance developments or enhancements.",

As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payors are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political scrutiny on pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain products to government-established pricing, potentially impose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law to penalties. Further, increased third-party utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program from expanded interpretations of the statute may have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.",

Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.

    "text": "The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.",

The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In February 2022, the trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However, in October 2022, the LTL bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued the mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to this matter. The State requested a new trial setting. Later in April 2023, the trial court set a new trial date for April 2024. The Company filed summary judgment and Daubert motions. The State filed a limited Daubert motion. The parties agreed to the Court's request for mediation. A pretrial conference is set for February 2024 and trial is scheduled for April 2024. However, the Company is actively engaged in resolution discussions concerning this matter.",

    "text": "In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. In March 2022, the New Mexico court denied the Company’s motion to compel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and denied the Company’s request for interlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ of Superintending Control and a Request for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations. In April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ before the New Mexico Supreme Court, which expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In December 2022, the State filed an appeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. Separately, in September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court granted the Company's request for a stay pending further briefing on the scope of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued the mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to this matter. While the State notified the New Mexico Supreme Court of the lifted stay of litigation in April 2023, the Court has not taken any action since being notified of the lifting of the stay and it remains in effect.",

Under the final national settlement agreement, which was announced in July 2021, the Company agreed to pay up to $5.0 billion to resolve all opioid lawsuits and future opioid claims by states, cities, counties, local school districts and other special districts, and tribal governments, contingent on sufficient participation by eligible government entities, and with credits back for entities that declined or were ineligible to participate. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims had been finalized and approximately 60% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal 2023. The expected payment schedule provides that approximately $0.7 billion of payments are to be paid by the end of fiscal 2024. The agreement is not an admission of liability or wrongdoing, and it provides for the release of all opioid-related claims against the Company, JPI, and their affiliates (including the Company’s former subsidiaries Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc.). As of January 2024, the Company and JPI have settled or otherwise resolved the opioid claims advanced by all government entity claimants except the City of Baltimore, a number of school districts and other claimants.",

DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country.

(Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600 Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300 plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. Of the cases subject to the MSA, 3,390 have been dismissed with prejudice. Ethicon has received releases from 3,584 plaintiffs, and releases continue to be submitted as part of the settlement process. Post-settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. In May 2023, Ethicon entered an additional settlement to resolve the claims of 292 Physiomesh claimants. That settlement is proceeding, and releases are being returned. As of December 31, 2023, there were 5 Physiomesh cases in the MDL and 3 in the New Jersey MCL which are not included in either settlement and which remain subject to the docket control orders.",

To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. The Company has recognized a total provision of approximately $9 billion, of which approximately one-third is recorded as a current liability and which encompasses actual and contemplated settlements. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of probable loss after the dismissal. The parties have not yet reached a full resolution of all talc matters and the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the remaining amount accrued.",
