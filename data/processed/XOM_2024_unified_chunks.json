These  actions  are  being  taken  both independently  by  national  and  regional  governments  and  within  the  framework  of  United  Nations  Conference  of  the  Parties  summits under which many countries of the world have endorsed objectives to reduce the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) over the coming decades, with an ambition ultimately to achieve “net zero”. Net zero means that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities would be balanced by actions that remove such gases from the atmosphere.

In  2023,  extensions  and discoveries,  primarily  in  the  United  States  and  Guyana,  resulted  in  the  addition  of  approximately  1.1  GOEB  of  proved  undeveloped reserves.  Also,  the  Corporation  reclassified  approximately  0.6  GOEB  of  proved  undeveloped  reserves  which  no  longer  met  the  SEC definition of proved reserves, primarily in the United States.",

    "text": "One of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved undeveloped reserves in Australia, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The Corporation is reasonably certain that these  proved  reserves  will  be  produced;  however,  the  timing  and  amount  recovered  can  be  affected  by  a  number  of  factors  including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. In Australia, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with future compression for the Gorgon Jansz LNG  project.  In  Kazakhstan,  the  proved  undeveloped  reserves  are  related  to  the  remainder  of  the  Tengizchevroil  joint  venture development that includes a production license in the Tengiz - Korolev field complex. The Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. In the United Arab Emirates,  proved  undeveloped  reserves  are  associated  with  an  approved  development  plan  and  continued  drilling  investment  for  the producing Upper Zakum field.",

Global  natural  gas  demand  is expected to rise nearly 25 percent from 2021 to 2050, with greater than 75 percent of that increase coming from the Asia Pacific region. Significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas - the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock formations - will help meet these needs. In total, about 50 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies is expected to come from unconventional sources. At the same time, conventionally-produced  natural  gas  is  likely  to  remain  the  cornerstone  of  global  supply,  meeting  around  two-thirds  of  worldwide demand in 2050. LNG trade will expand significantly, meeting about two thirds of the increase in global demand growth, with much of this supply expected to help meet rising demand in Asia Pacific.",

Lower- emission fuels, hydrogen-based fuels, and carbon capture and storage are three key lower-carbon solutions needed to support a lower- emission future, in addition to wind and solar. Along with electrification, lower-emission fuels are expected to play an important role in decarbonization of the transportation sector, particularly in hard-to-decarbonize areas, such as aviation. Low-carbon hydrogen will be a key enabler replacing traditional furnace fuel to decarbonize the industrial sector. Hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels like ammonia are also expected to make inroads into commercial transportation as technology improves to lower its cost and policy develops to support the needed infrastructure development. Carbon capture and storage on its own, or in combination with hydrogen production, is among the few proven technologies that could enable CO2 emission reductions from high-emitting and hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as power generation and heavy industries, including manufacturing, refining, and petrochemicals.",

For many years, the Corporation has taken into account policies established to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term Outlook. The climate accord reached at the 2015 Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. Our Outlook reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the successful achievement of the global aggregation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted by the nations that are signatories to the Paris Agreement, as available at the end of 2022. We have assumed success of these NDCs, despite the 2023 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report projecting that the G20 members will fall short of their NDCs. Our Outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate-related government policies, which often target specific sectors. For purposes of the Outlook, a proxy cost on energy-related CO2 emissions is assumed, based on regional considerations and relative levels of economic development, and by 2050, reaches up to $150 per metric ton for OECD nations and up to $100 per metric ton for non-OECD nations. China and other leading non-OECD nations are expected to trail OECD policy initiatives. Nevertheless, as people and nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will continue to need  practical  solutions  that  do  not  jeopardize  the  affordability  or  reliability  of  the  energy  they  need.  The  Corporation  continues  to monitor the updates to the NDCs that nations provided around COP 28 in Dubai in 2023, as well as other policy developments in light of net-zero ambitions formulated by some nations.",

ExxonMobil  operations  continue  to  deliver  industry-leading  capital  efficiency  and  cost  performance  by leveraging scale, integration, and technology.

In 2023, operation teams sustained zero routine flaring , completed the program to eliminate over 6,000 pneumatic venting devices, increased electrification of operations, signed long- term  agreements  to  use  lower-carbon  wind  power,  and  expanded  continuous  emissions  monitoring  programs.  In  October  2023, ExxonMobil announced a definitive agreement to acquire Pioneer in an all-stock transaction valued at $59.5 billion , more than doubling our  Permian  footprint.

Management believes that prices  over  the  long  term  must  be  sufficient  to  generate  investments  in  energy  supply  to  meet  global  demand.  Although  prices  will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC+ investment activities and production policies also  have  an  impact  on  world  oil  supplies.  The  demand  side  is  largely  a  function  of  general  economic  activities,  alternative  energy sources,  and  levels  of  prosperity.  During  the  lifespan  of  its  major  assets,  the  Corporation  expects  that  oil  and  gas  prices  and  industry margins will experience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings,  or  even  losses.

Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on the assumptions developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  and  are  consistent  with  the  criteria  management  uses  to  evaluate  investment opportunities.  These  evaluations  make  use  of  the  Corporation’s  assumptions  of  future  capital  allocations,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas commodity  prices  including  price  differentials,  refining  and  chemical  margins,  volumes,  development  and  operating  costs  including greenhouse  gas  emission  prices,  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.

Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales.

Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property  (whether  unproved  or  proved)  are  capitalized when  incurred.  As  disclosed  by  management,  proved  oil  and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes  are  used  as  the  basis  to  calculate  unit-of- production  depreciation  rates  for  most  upstream  assets.  The  estimation  of  proved  oil  and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes  is  an  ongoing process based on technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, development and production costs, among other factors. As further disclosed by management, reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves and Resources Group (together \"management's specialists\").",

The prices of certain sales are based on price indices that are sometimes not available until the next period. In such cases, estimated realizations are accrued when the sale is recognized, and are finalized when the price is available. Such adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods are not significant. Payment for revenue transactions is typically due within 30 days. Future volume delivery obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of the period are expected to be fulfilled through ordinary production or purchases.

Management believes that prices  over  the  long  term  must  be  sufficient  to  generate  investments  in  energy  supply  to  meet  global  demand.  Although  prices  will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamentals. On the supply side, industry production from mature fields is declining. This is being offset by investments to generate production from new discoveries, field developments, and technology and efficiency advancements. OPEC investment activities and production policies also  have  an  impact  on  world  oil  supplies.  The  demand  side  is  largely  a  function  of  general  economic  activities,  alternative  energy sources,  and  levels  of  prosperity.  During  the  lifespan  of  its  major  assets,  the  Corporation  expects  that  oil  and  gas  prices  and  industry margins will experience significant volatility. Consequently, these assets will experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings,  or  even  losses.

In light of this, an impairment assessment was conducted, and management determined that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. As a result, the Corporation’s first-quarter 2022 earnings  included  after-tax  charges  of  $3.4  billion  largely  representing  the  full  impairment  of  its  operations  related  to  Sakhalin.  On  a before-tax  basis,  the  charges  amounted  to  $4.6  billion,  substantially  all  of  which  is  reflected  in  the  line  captioned  “Depreciation  and depletion  (including  impairments)”  on  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income.  Effective  October  14,  2022,  the  Russian  government unilaterally terminated the Corporation’s interests in Sakhalin, transferring operations to a Russian operator. The Corporation’s fourth- quarter 2022 results include an after-tax benefit of $1.1 billion largely reflecting the impact of the expropriation on the company’s various obligations related to Sakhalin. The Corporation's exit from the project resulted in approximately 150 million oil-equivalent barrels no longer qualifying as proved reserves at year-end 2022.",

During 2023 and 2022, certain governments outside the United States provided payments which,  individually  and  in  aggregate,  were  immaterial  to  the  Corporation's  financial  results.  Among  these  are  programs  where governments  endeavor  to  stabilize  or  cap  fuel  and  energy  costs  for  local  consumers.  To  compensate  producers  who  sell  at  the government-mandated prices, these governments provide reimbursements to the producers. In 2023 such reimbursements were negligible and in 2022 these reimbursements totaled approximately $1.5 billion before tax, which were reflected as reductions to the line captioned \"Crude oil and product purchases\" on the Consolidated Statement of Income. At December 31, 2022, \"Notes and accounts receivable - net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet included $0.5 billion related to pending government reimbursements. The terms and conditions of these programs, including their duration, vary by country. In the event that any of these programs are discontinued, the Corporation does not expect a significant impact to its financial results. Additionally, in connection with cap and trade programs in certain countries outside the United States, companies receive allowances from governments covering a specified level of emissions from facilities they operate. The terms of these programs vary by country. The Corporation records these allowances at a nominal amount, generally in \"Inventories - Crude oil, products and merchandise\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

The  majority  of  the  awards  have  graded  vesting  periods,  with  50  percent  of  the  shares  and  units  in  each  award vesting  after  three  years,  and  the  remaining  50  percent  vesting  after  seven  years. Some  management,  professional,  and  technical participants will receive awards that vest in full after three years. Awards granted to a small number of senior executives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years for the remaining 50 percent of the award, except that for awards granted prior to 2020 the vesting of the 10-year portion of the award is delayed until retirement if later than 10 years.",

Management  has  regular  litigation  reviews,  including  updates  from  corporate  and  outside  counsel,  to  assess  the  need  for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does  not  record  liabilities  when  the  likelihood  that  the  liability  has  been  incurred  is  probable  but  the  amount  cannot  be  reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes should be disclosed. State and local governments and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States and  its  territories  have  filed  a  number  of  legal  proceedings  against  several  oil  and  gas  companies,  including  ExxonMobil,  requesting unprecedented  legal  and  equitable  relief  for  various  alleged  injuries  purportedly  connected  to  climate  change.  These  lawsuits  assert  a variety  of  novel,  untested  claims  under  statutory  and  common  law.  Additional  such  lawsuits  may  be  filed.  We  believe  the  legal  and factual theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless and represent an inappropriate attempt to use the court system to usurp the proper role of policymakers in addressing the societal challenges of climate change.",

On  October  6,  2022,  European  Union  (“EU”)  Member  States  adopted  an  EU Council  Regulation  which,  along  with  other  measures,  introduced  a  new  tax  described  as  an  emergency  intervention  to  address  high energy  prices.  This  regulation  imposed  a  mandatory  tax  on  certain  companies  active  in  the  crude  petroleum,  coal,  natural  gas,  and refinery  sectors.  The  regulation  required  Member  States  to  levy  a  minimum  33  percent  tax  on  in-scope  companies’  2022  and/or  2023 “surplus profits\", defined in the regulation as taxable profits exceeding 120 percent of the annual average profits during the 2018-2021 period. EU Member States were required to implement the tax, or an equivalent national measure, by December 31, 2022. The enactment of these regulations by Member States resulted in an after-tax charge of approximately $1.8 billion to the Corporation’s fourth-quarter 2022  results  and  approximately  $0.2  billion  in  2023,  mainly  reflected  in  the  line  “Income  tax  expense  (benefit)”  on  the  Consolidated Statement of Income.",
