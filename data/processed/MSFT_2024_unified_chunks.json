Our goal was to train and certify 10 million learners by 2025. As of May 2024, we have surpassed that goal, training and certifying 12.6 million learners. We also launched a campaign in the United States in 2021 to help skill and recruit 250,000 people into the nation’s cybersecurity workforce by 2025, representing half of the country’s workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of charge to all  of  the  nation’s  higher  education  institutions,  providing  training  for  new  and  existing  faculty,  and  providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. The cyber skills initiative has expanded to 27 additional countries  that  show  elevated  cyberthreat  risks  coupled  with  significant  gaps  in  their  cybersecurity  workforces,  where we’ve partnered with nonprofits and other educational institutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers.",

    "text": "We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that  may  apply  to  our  products  and  online  services  offerings,  and  those  that  impose  requirements  related  to  user privacy,  telecommunications,  data  storage  and  protection,  advertising,  and  online  content.  How  these  laws  and regulations  apply  to  our  business  is  often  unclear,  subject  to  change  over  time,  and  sometimes  may  be  inconsistent from  jurisdiction  to  jurisdiction.  To  comply  with  the  accelerating  global  regulatory  obligations,  we  established  a regulatory governance framework and to create a repeatable system-focused approach to regulatory governance with an initial focus on four domains: Responsible AI, Privacy, Digital Safety, and Cybersecurity. The framework is designed to  help  us  maintain  customer  trust  and  confidence  in  our  products,  remain  in  compliance  with  regulators  around  the globe,  and  effectively  scale  our  capability  to  address  the  growing  number  of  complex  regulations.  Through  the framework, our legal and regulatory subject matter experts ingest regulations, develop standards and implementation guidance, and, when appropriate, work with our engineers to develop and implement products to monitor compliance. Our  business  teams,  with  legal  support,  manage  the  compliance  programs  and  prepare  external  regulatory  and commercial reporting, and our internal audit teams conduct reviews of our programs and processes. While we intended to create a unified approach to regulatory compliance, some of the programs and processes established pursuant to the framework are tailored to meet specific regulatory obligations, such as with the creation of independent compliance functions required by the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act and the EU Digital Services Act, which oversee, monitor, and assess the company’s compliance with these acts.",

We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc., and in October 2023 we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard , Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”). In January 2023 we announced the  third  phase  of  our  OpenAI  strategic  partnership.  Acquisitions  and  other  transactions  and  arrangements  involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return  on  our  investment,  that  they  raise  new  compliance-related  obligations  and  challenges,  that  we  have  difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other  businesses,  or  that  announced  transactions  may  not  be  completed.  If  an  arrangement  fails  to  adequately anticipate  changing  circumstances  and  interests  of  a  party,  it  may  result  in  early  termination  or  renegotiation  of  the arrangement. We also have limited ability to control or influence third parties with whom we have arrangements, which may impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits. The success of these transactions and arrangements depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as  well  as  the  acquired  companies’  ability  to  meet  our  policies  and  processes  in  areas  such  as  data  governance, privacy,  and  cybersecurity.  It  may  take  longer  than  expected  to  realize  the  full  benefits  from  these  transactions  and arrangements, such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. In addition, an acquisition may be subject to challenge even after it has been completed. For example, the Federal Trade Commission continues to challenge our Activision Blizzard acquisition and could, if successful, alter or unwind the transaction.

These actors use a wide variety of methods, which  include  developing  and  deploying  malicious  software;  exploiting  known  and  potential  vulnerabilities  or intentionally designed processes in hardware, software, or other infrastructure to attack our products and services or gain  access  to  our  networks  and  datacenters;  using  social  engineering  techniques  to  induce  our  employees,  users, partners, or customers to disclose sensitive information, such as passwords, or take other actions to gain access to our data  or  our  users’  or  customers’  data;  or  acting  in  a  coordinated  manner  or  conducting  coordinated  attacks.  For example, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 19, 2024 and amended on March 8, 2024, beginning in late November 2023, a nation-state associated threat actor used a password spray attack to compromise a legacy test account and, in turn, gain access to Microsoft email accounts.

Nation-state  attacks against us, our customers, or our partners have and may continue to intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero-day”) vulnerabilities, such as the attack in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the  attackers  exploited  the  vulnerabilities  before  patching  to  install  additional  malware  to  further  compromise customers’  systems.

Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords.

As we continue to grow the  number,  breadth,  and  scale  of  our  cloud-based  offerings,  we  store  and  process  increasingly  large  amounts  of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of  an  external  environment  increasingly  hostile  to  information  security.  Despite  our  efforts  to  improve  the  security controls  across  our  business  groups  and  geographies,  it  is  possible  our  security  controls  over  personal  data,  our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. Relatedly, despite our efforts to continuously improve security controls, it is possible that we may fail to identify or mitigate insider threat activities that could lead to the misuse of our systems or customer and user data. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our  customer  or  user  data  may  use  this  data  in  unauthorized  ways.  Improper  disclosure  or  misuse  could  harm  our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting  in  increased  costs  or  loss  of  revenue.  Our  software  products  and  services  also  enable  our  customers  and users  to  store  and  process  personal  data  on-premises  or  in  a  cloud-based  environment  we  host.  Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and  elsewhere,  we  advocate  for  transparency  concerning  these  requests  and  appropriate  limitations  on  government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security  measures  we  may  take  to  address  customer  or  user  concerns,  or  constraints  on  our  flexibility  to  determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may increase costs or hinder sales of our products and services.",

The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based  services  internationally  relies  increasingly  on  the  movement  of  data  across  national  boundaries.  Legal requirements  relating  to  the  collection,  storage,  handling,  and  transfer  of  personal  data  continue  to  evolve.  For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which  applies  to  all  of  our  activities  conducted  from  an  establishment  in  the  EU  or  related  to  products  and  services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the  EU  has  been  developing  new  requirements  related  to  the  use  of  data,  including  in  the  Digital  Markets  Act,  the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services.  Engineering  efforts  to  build  and  maintain  capabilities  to  facilitate  compliance  with  these  laws  involve substantial  expense  and  the  diversion  of  engineering  resources  from  other  projects.  We  might  experience  reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we  fail  to  comply,  or  if  regulators  assert  we  have  failed  to  comply  (including  in  response  to  complaints  made  by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of product offerings or of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The  highest  fines  assessed  under  GDPR  have  recently  been  increasing,  especially  against  large  technology companies, and European data protection authorities have taken action to block or remove services from their markets. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or  expanding,  laws  and  regulations  imposing  obligations  regarding  the  collection,  handling,  and  transfer  of  personal data.",

The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business,  but  generally  include  parts  and  labor  over  a  period  generally  ranging  from  90  days  to  three  years.  For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.",

The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect.

The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases  to  the  trial  court  for  further  proceedings  under  that  standard.  The  plaintiffs  have  filed  supplemental  expert evidence,  portions  of  which  were  stricken  by  the  court.  A  hearing  on  general  causation  took  place  in  September  of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause  brain  cancer  and  entered  an  order  excluding  all  of  plaintiffs’  experts  from  testifying.  The  parties  agreed  to  a stipulated dismissal of the consolidated cases to allow plaintiffs to appeal the expert testimony order. Plaintiffs appealed the court’s order in August of 2023, and the parties have filed their briefs on the appeal. A hearing on the status of the stayed cases occurred in December of 2023. In July 2024, the court entered summary judgment in nine of the stayed",
